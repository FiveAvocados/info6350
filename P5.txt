1;Speaker 2;00:00:35.540;00:00:48.940;00:00:13.400;"Yeah. Cool. So you want me to fill out the survey right now?"
2;Speaker 1;00:00:49.080;00:00:49.760;00:00:00.680;"Yes."
3;Speaker 2;00:02:48.790;00:02:59.030;00:00:10.240;"Can you elaborate a little bit more on the question? Are there any interruptions that hinder you from conducting qualitative data analysis with scrutiny?"
4;Speaker 1;00:03:01.610;00:03:36.740;00:00:35.730;"When I had pilots to do with other participants, they mentioned because of like time constraints or because of lack of collaborators. So scrutiny means it's difficult to go over your raw data by line or instead you just watch video of the recorded user study or because you have so much meeting, it's difficult to focus on analysis work. "
5;Speaker 2;00:03:37.360;00:03:38.300;00:00:00.940;"That makes sense."
6;Speaker 1;00:03:38.440;00:03:39.320;00:00:00.880;"Thank you."
7;Speaker 2;00:04:37.770;00:04:39.720;00:00:01.950;"Okay, I just filled it out."
8;Speaker 1;00:04:40.170;00:04:52.110;00:00:11.940;"Thank you so much. Then can you briefly describe what was your role as a researcher at the company that you worked? Yeah."
9;Speaker 2;00:04:52.170;00:05:45.990;00:00:53.820;"So I worked as a design research/engineering intern at this company. It was actually a textiles company and they were interested at the time in moving into the smart textiles area. And so I was hired to do product development. So it was largely exploratory in the sense that they were interested in doing smart textiles. But we're like, wait, what are the potential for what potential applications can we do? So I was on a team with some other UI design people and then also an engineer and so we pretty much like  did the initial the whole product design pipeline."
10;Speaker 1;00:05:48.330;00:07:22.260;00:01:33.930;"Thank you. Now I'm going to share a link to a Google slide and there I'm going to ask you to make a simple diagram showing you the timeline of how your team developed a product. Okay. I shared the link to the chat. Okay. So if you see the Google slide, the first one is an example of other participants who drew her general pipeline she followed when she was developing a product. And the second one is also an example of the same diagram from the other participant. And on that page three, you can use shapes and arrows to make your own diagram. Okay. And also please include your user research part and show me like where it is located within the process."
11;Speaker 2;00:07:22.950;00:07:23.700;00:00:00.750;"Okay."
12;Speaker 1;00:07:24.690;00:07:25.620;00:00:00.930;"Thank you."
13;Speaker 2;00:08:04.530;00:08:22.920;00:00:18.390;"You want me to talk through as I'm typing? I guess what I'm also curious about because you're doing a pilot study, it's also like, let me know if there's things that I can do to help you figure out the event because as you're running."
14;Speaker 1;00:08:26.470;00:08:47.010;00:00:20.540;"I think you can elaborate while you make the diagram. Yeah, let's do that. Because before I ask question after the participant finished their diagram. But I think it's also helpful if I listen while you make a diagram."
15;Speaker 2;00:08:47.330;00:09:59.570;00:01:12.240;"Okay, sounds good. So the first thing I put here is initial brainstorm on topic area and I remember this was, like we were deciding because there's, like, so many different applications that we could do. This was like, are we working in a medical context? Are we going to be building for a home context? Because we're like, how do we even recruit users or interviews before? Because talking to someone who works in the medical field is very different than talking to somebody who works at home. So then we did interviews to understand user needs and I believe we went we decided to focus on home context."
16;Speaker 1;00:10:00.070;00:12:36.180;00:02:36.110;"And so we were just like, talking to people who look for people who own their homes, who rented try to get like, a diverse set of people who, in a way, it was easy because we're like, do you live in a home? So in a way, a lot of people fit into who we wanted to interview. But then at the same time, you also wanted to represent, in this case, like, represent a diverse array of opinions or not opinions, diverse array of responses. So that was probably like the trickier part. And then brainstorm design idea generation. Maybe I can make these. And then we worked on some initial prototypes. And I'm going to add this box here to say, like, all throughout had meetings with management. I was going to say, you're like the product directors because they gave us feedback and also were like, oh, you know, the people who worked at the I think they were like the ones who, I think started the smart tech style initiatives to kind of get their feedback on kind of like, what the. So I think what was interesting was that it was like a company that wasn't necessarily a tech company."
17;Speaker 1;00:12:37.650;00:14:55.090;00:02:17.440;"This was more of like a company. I mean, textiles are like a form of technology. So in a way. But it was a company that was pivoting more towards IoT development or more like smart devices that wasn't like, versus if it was like intel or another company. In a way, their way of product design and development, I think was also different because in that case, it was like, if you're developing towels or linens, you're not necessarily like, it's just like, different. It's a little bit more straightforward in some sense. All right. And then after initial prototypes, we did some, like, user testing. And I would say this is like, all. And then after that, I'm sure it was like the design reiterations. And I think around the same time, we had a team member who was doing more of a financial calculations just to kind of be able to kind of like, if this went to market in this amount of time, what would the cost be? Because you're taking into account, like, the materials we use, like, development, because to go from the product prototype to it being woven out and being sold, there's like a big pipeline."
18;Speaker 1;00:14:55.140;00:16:29.280;00:01:34.140;"So kind of like financial, because then this also kind of impacted how we were thinking about the design iteration. Because when you do the user testing, there's always like, oh, well, what if it could do these ten other things, right? Let's make the most magical thing ever so that I can do all these things. But then it's like when you have someone who's, like, doing the actual financial stuff or even just like, it's this interesting moment where you're understanding the tensions between what your users are telling you and like, what the people, what you're getting the feedback on and what is actually feasible from technical and economic perspective. And then in this case, for this particular project, it was we did a final demo. I feel like this is working in the more like design research when it's like the technologies isn't quite there yet, it's usually like a final demo. I think that's about right."
19;Speaker 2;00:16:32.850;00:17:08.520;00:00:35.670;"And I think it's great to listen how you describe its process while making the diagram. I think it was really helpful, and I came up with few questions. So there are like two qualitative data in this process. Like, first one is before you come up with design idea generation, and then the second one is after you make initial prototypes. Do you think there are some differences between those two user research?"
20;Speaker 1;00:17:09.869;00:18:35.390;00:01:25.520;"Yeah, I think with the interviews, I actually really like interviews because at that point you're not even thinking about the technologies in the back of your head. Like, in the back of my head, I am in a design role, but for the most part, you're just kind of like listening and just kind of understanding certain things that come up and identifying certain things that and then I think at this stage, you don't even have to think through what your product will actually be. So in a way, it's a bit more free. And it's interesting because I think that has in certain ways impacted my own research direction in that it's like sometimes there is this pressure to especially when you're working in a more industry context, to be like, at the end of the day, you have to come up with a product or come up with a thing. Versus, I do remember when we were doing a lot of these studies or the initial interviews, people were talking had this concern around air quality. This happened in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and there's actually a lot of different air quality issues in the city and with houses. There's a lot of older houses as well."
21;Speaker 1;00:18:35.450;00:19:09.620;00:00:34.170;"So then it's like all these things that I think are just really interesting and understanding, kind of like the lived experience of experiencing a place that I think was helpful. I just think it's like super interesting, but it is very fast in a way. It's very like, all right, we talk to these people and how do we kind of like distill certain concepts that can then be translatable into design ideas?"
22;Speaker 2;00:19:09.770;00:19:22.050;00:00:12.280;"I see. Do you think those interesting things you found from the initial interview are represented or included in the final project products?"
23;Speaker 1;00:19:22.230;00:19:47.520;00:00:25.290;"To an extent, yeah, I think to an extent we wound up focusing without having to get into too much details. We wound up focusing on home health. And so that was something that did take inspiration from our interviews. Yeah, I see."
24;Speaker 2;00:19:47.850;00:20:02.630;00:00:14.780;"Okay, then how about the user testing after the initial prototypes? What was the main focus of that qualitative data analysis?"
25;Speaker 1;00:20:03.670;00:21:07.180;00:01:03.510;"Yeah, we had our initial prototypes and then showing it to the people. Some of them were people that we had previously interviewed as well. And so having them walk through in a way, like it was a prototype in the sense that it looked like it could work through the person. And I feel like we even had a room set up, like a bedroom in a way, or maybe I think we settled on, like, making like a bedroom and having people come through and, like talking through, providing enough context of what the product is or how you're supposed to work with it and kind of getting recording responses and having a set or questionnaire. In a way, it was kind of like a semi structured interview and that you're just talking through what the product was."
26;Speaker 2;00:21:08.410;00:21:33.340;00:00:24.930;"Okay, then let's move on to the next page. On the next page, we were going to make a diagram about user process of qualitative data analysis that you take. And can you make a diagram for qualitative data analysis like you did for the product development process?"
27;Speaker 1;00:21:33.790;00:21:39.610;00:00:05.820;"Yeah. Cool. So this is more about the analysis."
28;Speaker 2;00:21:39.790;00:21:40.520;00:00:00.730;"Yeah."
29;Speaker 1;00:21:41.750;00:23:19.320;00:01:37.570;"So I'm just going to make this box for data collection. It's funny because currently I'm doing my dissertation field work right now where it's very oriented towards qualitative data analysis. I'm doing more like ethnographic work. So I'm like very deep in the data collection process. I acknowledge the labor of doing the data collection. So once I have my data. So I guess while I do data and I will promise with that, how I'm probably going to talk about this is, like, very reflective of sense kind of moving from design to more social science work, how that's kind of worked out in terms of data analysis. And so one thing that I do now while I'm doing data collection, so I do a lot of Memoing, and Memoing is just like a way. So it's like from grounded theory, just kind of like thinking through what are kind of emergent themes and analysis that you're going through. So that's something that I do throughout the process to kind of start orienting myself towards the data analysis. I guess I don't know how to show it maybe like this."
30;No speaker;00:23:20.850;00:23:21.600;00:00:00.750;"Okay."
31;Speaker 1;00:23:26.350;00:25:47.170;00:02:20.820;"Let'S see. It's interesting to think through how to show this process via diagramming. I'll put that there for now, and then I think there's you usually like a first pass at finding themes. So this is based on the memos and based on the research questions, I usually have a you already have some idea of certain theme merging themes. So I'm going to do this for now, even though I don't know if I agree with it. So find themes, and then I guess it's pretty messy. I guess it's like finding initial themes or just kind of like reorienting. Kind of like, how do you start to even think through, like the analysis of sometimes, like, a lot of data and then doing qualitative coding is probably like the next step. So then it's like going back into the data itself and then doing kind of an iterative process with the initial themes because sometimes you're like, oh, there's actually a lot of stuff here that matches this theme. Sometimes there isn't. And you're like, okay, I have to think about other things. So this is and then there's like a bunch of iterations on themes encoding. Let's see, iterations on themes encoding."
32;Speaker 1;00:25:47.670;00:26:09.060;00:00:21.390;"And then sometimes I'll do during this process, I also write memos because it's kind of like a nice way to help synthesize some of the emerging ideas to see how they start to fit together. Or sometimes you're like, why do I think this particular theme is actually important?"
33;No speaker;00:26:09.990;00:26:10.740;00:00:00.750;"Right."
34;Speaker 1;00:26:11.610;00:28:13.240;00:02:01.630;"So I'll put this over here and put it over here. Let's see. And I think depending on what the purpose of the study is, I would think for industry or when I've done it in the past. So it's kind of like being able to put it in presentation format or put it in a presentable format. Let's say that means in a design team, it's usually like you're presenting it to your other team members. So it's usually like sometimes it's like a small report, but sometimes, you know, people like, realistically, it's like a presentation that your team members can look at. I'll say like slides for team members. And then I guess academia would be like a paper, but that's for like, you know, and I guess in certain cases, if you're working in industry, you still publish, so that might be something that still happens. And so that's a whole other set of process. But I think to some degree, with the iterations on themes and coding, you can usually get to a place where you can make a set of slides for that they can understand."
35;Speaker 2;00:28:13.440;00:28:33.750;00:00:20.310;"Right. I see. Interesting. Do you think you can follow all these steps while you're working at the industry, or do you think there are some differences between conducting qualitative data analysis and academic Mia and industry?"
36;Speaker 1;00:28:35.510;00:30:00.440;00:01:24.930;"Yeah, I think the pacing is definitely different in a certain way because with academia, I'm currently on a project right now where we have so it's one thing that's good is that we're working as a group to do the qualitative data collection and analysis, but we're definitely also working within the rhythms of the semester, which means if the Professor I'm working with is like teaching a class, if there's like I'm taking a class or like other things, that kind of like just another thing that's layered on. Yeah. And I do think with industry, there's definitely more of a time crunch because it is like, okay, well, this phase is going to be like three weeks or this phase is going to be like two weeks. I remember talking to a friend who did she was specifically on a rapid research experience team that was doing like one week turnaround for user studies, which is really intense. But in a way it's like following a different set of timelines. So in a way, what I put down here is definitely like an idealized process."
37;Speaker 2;00:30:00.830;00:30:01.580;00:00:00.750;"Right."
38;Speaker 1;00:30:04.650;00:30:37.450;00:00:32.800;"In terms of the usual process, it's usually like what I try to follow. Like for the project that I had described, we kind of did follow these things. I would say there wasn't as much time for Memoing and I think in terms of the memo process, I think a lot of people do that. They just don't make it more formalized in the sense of taking time to reflect and type out what you're finding. But I find that really helpful."
39;Speaker 2;00:30:37.950;00:30:47.040;00:00:09.090;"I see. Then do you also like transcribe the recordings when you're doing the qualitative data analysis at work?"
40;Speaker 1;00:30:47.790;00:31:06.950;00:00:19.160;"Oh, yeah, I guess I didn't include that data collection. And I think that would be like I try to do like as I collect the data, I like, so this is also like data collection and like preparation."
41;Speaker 2;00:31:08.050;00:31:08.950;00:00:00.900;"I see."
42;Speaker 1;00:31:09.110;00:32:07.710;00:00:58.600;"So I mean just something that I've been where it's like if you do an interview, you just try to do the transcription as early as possible. And so sometimes with transcription, I mean, I think I guess there's like these like AI generated transcription services now which are really great and like zoomed as a generated script, but it's also really nice to type it out yourself sometimes so you can focus on you can kind of like relive the transcript, relive the interview in a way and find themes a little bit better. Right. Any notes that sometimes you'll ask a question and you're like, wait, that wasn't a very good question. Or you're like, oh, wait, next time I should ask this, which is like the benefit of the semi structured interview being able to make notes of like, oh, this is how I'm going to adjust. Like the data collection."
43;Speaker 2;00:32:08.510;00:32:56.790;00:00:48.280;"I see. Okay, then I will ask another question, I think from the previous process you mentioned. Even though you find very novel and interesting insights from the qualitative data analysis, sometimes there are some conflicts because of financial constraints or because of limited resources. You cannot make prototypes for all of ten interesting ideas. Do you think, like in academia it is more important to find novel insights even though it's not feasible compared to in industry, it is always the feasibility is prioritized."
44;Speaker 1;00:32:58.190;00:34:07.420;00:01:09.230;"Yeah, that's a good question. I think it's like in a way like you're looking for what works in a way because I have worked in smart textile labs and for academia in certain ways, I would say our prototypes are not as robust as the ones I've made for industry in that you just have to make it work so that you can write the paper right away. They can be like really novel. But then if you kind of go into the depths of it it's like not as a prototype that works when someone's, like, standing right beside it like that. And there's also, like, diminish that work, but it definitely is. I definitely do think you can prioritize, like, a certain level of novelty or within academia sometimes, but it also depends on what the focus is as well. I see."
45;Speaker 2;00:34:08.710;00:34:39.110;00:00:30.400;"Ok, then let's go to the next page. And if you can have any type of support for finding insights from Qualitative data, like, what support would you want to receive? In this case? If you think about finding more novel and interesting ideas from qualitative data, then what kind of support will make it possible to discover new insights?"
46;Speaker 1;00:34:40.090;00:34:42.159;00:00:02.069;"Yeah. Do you want me to write it down?"
47;Speaker 2;00:34:44.230;00:35:14.240;00:00:30.010;"Yes. And also yes. Originally I thought you can copy paste the process diagram you made for the Qualitative data analysis and then Mark where the support will be needed within that process. And then you can just describe what kind of support you want to get."
48;Speaker 1;00:35:16.430;00:35:19.230;00:00:02.800;"I just took a picture of it instead of dragging."
49;Speaker 2;00:35:21.110;00:35:25.460;00:00:04.350;"Hold on, just choose whichever method you want."
50;Speaker 1;00:35:37.530;00:37:15.170;00:01:37.640;"In a way, I almost want support here in the data collection and preparation process because that part takes so much time. I think setting up the infrastructure or just, like, making sure that everything is in the right place, that when you're collecting data, all that is just really kind of difficult to keep track of sometimes, especially if you're sharing it and making sure that all the file names are in the right. It's helpful when you're manually doing it to just kind of be really attentive to details or even have a template of like, okay, I usually keep a document of like, this is how it's like a meta data document where it's just like how I'm keeping everything, how I'm naming everything, where I'm storing everything. But then yet I still mess up from time to time. Because sometimes at some point, it's just like you're doing so many interviews or you're, like, really busy, so you just forget and you just so it's almost like there's, like, best practices. But then there's also just like, in reality, it's actually pretty tricky that process, because then I feel like at least if I don't have my data organized well, it makes the rest of the process more difficult because then you're like, all right, where did this document go?"
51;Speaker 1;00:37:15.210;00:38:14.450;00:00:59.240;"Where did that document? I mean, with the Qualitative coding, I use so many different types of software at this point or not equally. There are somewhere a lot better than others, but they're all just, like, not really clear sometimes. Or they're just like it's like the interface is clunky. So right now I'm using Deduce for a project, and it's okay. But the interface is just like sometimes there's just, like, things that I don't need on the screen. So it's for mixed methods work, but we're only using it for Qualitative data analysis. So then I can't remove the parts that are quant based, even though it's like, helpful to know that it's there. It's just like when I open the screen, there's this big chunk that's like reserved a quant analysis."
52;Speaker 2;00:38:14.640;00:38:15.500;00:00:00.860;"I see."
53;Speaker 1;00:38:20.790;00:39:20.020;00:00:59.230;"If there's a way to and maybe I'll put this again here, like kind of the iterations. One thing that I found, perhaps, that I've had to do my own work around in this case is to kind of is when I'm doing iterations and if there was a way to keep track of how your thinking evolved or kind of like to know, because sometimes you're like, okay, well, this whole thing needs to be coded as something else, but it would be nice to know what was it coded before as a way to just kind of like track those changes in a way. And I think that's helpful because sometimes you've realized that you're like saying it one way and then you're like, wait, the first time I coded, it was actually like a good way to yeah."
54;Speaker 2;00:39:20.160;00:39:21.700;00:00:01.540;"I know what you're saying."
55;Speaker 1;00:39:29.030;00:40:36.600;00:01:07.570;"And I feel like something here around having others, like coding your data, at least some of the platforms I've used, like if there was a way to kind of like build a code book into the software that I'm talking about because it's like you have the space for the description of it. But if there was a way that if you were going to just have someone else precode the data for you to kind of make sure that you're coding it in describing things in the way that you need. Like if there was a way to do that process that was more linear than having because I definitely remember being on different projects where sometimes you actually have a printed code book and then you have your assistant or someone just sit there and go through it or just have like an open Google Doc and go through it. But if there's a way to build support for kind of doing this kind of coding for when you have other people."
56;Speaker 2;00:40:37.110;00:41:07.100;00:00:29.990;"I see the software that you're currently using don't support, like, real time collaboration while you're coding does, like, first author have to go through the coding, and then if that author shared the code book, then the second or third collaborators go through the whole data using the code book."
57;Speaker 1;00:41:07.610;00:42:39.360;00:01:31.750;"Yeah, well, the one that I'm working, the Deduce, does support real time collaboration. There is a delay, though. But in a way, the delay is good because sometimes if you do something, they'll be like, are you sure you want to do that almost real time, which I think is I think it's fine because with this project, it's like three people who have access to who are doing the coding, and very rarely are we all working on coding at the same time. So in a way, it's fine. I think more so on having like the code book. Cause I think I guess what has happened in this project at least is and on other projects it's like usually it's like they have to have to happen like simultaneously between all the authors. So we're all the team members. So in the project that I was describing with the smart textiles, like it was like me and the other person, we were like we each I think did a pass through our codes and then you compare the codes to see what themes did overlap and then kind of work from there."
58;Speaker 2;00:42:39.690;00:43:09.110;00:00:29.420;"I see you mentioned you worked with other people during qualitative data process, but were there any occasions that you have to have to work on the whole process on your own? Do you think having a collaborator help you to view the data set in a new perspective and understand more deeply and come up with more better ideas?"
59;Speaker 1;00:43:10.150;00:44:22.350;00:01:12.200;"Yeah, I think having collaborators is really helpful in a sense. I feel like when I've worked on certain projects by myself, so like my dissertation is pretty much by myself. What I do find helpful is that I mean, I have my advisor so I work with Steve Jackson and actually while I'm doing my data collection, even in this very early part, that's not even going into analysis yet. So I write memos pretty frequently and he reads my memos and he's like, oh, I've noticed these things. So in a way it's like having a person just kind of be able to see what's happening from at a distance, which I think is always helpful. Like right now, this other project I'm on, we have a new team member and what's really helpful is that they'll say like, oh, it sounds like you're doing this. And then like me and the other person are like, wow, that's so insightful because you've been working in the data for a really long time, you might not notice certain things."
60;Speaker 2;00:44:22.400;00:44:45.620;00:00:23.220;"Right. I see. Then do you think the quality of collaborator also matters? Like, for example, you get feedback from your advisor, but do you think like feedback that you get from like random stranger or like friends who don't know much about your work will be helpful as well?"
61;Speaker 1;00:44:46.850;00:45:47.480;00:01:00.630;"Yeah. No, I mean, I do think but sometimes it's a little tricky because of like IRB stuff if it's academic related or with the industry position. I had an NDA, so it's like the amount that you can disclose with other people sometimes can be like a little challenging, I think. I feel like with the IRB, it's like just sharing who you're talking to. But with like the NBA, sometimes you just can't like talk about material ways that don't sound extremely suspicious. So in a way like I would say that was probably like a constraint that in terms of getting outside help, but it is really helpful. I do find it helpful to talk to other people, especially people who don't like work in tech, people who don't even care about tech kind of get their insights sometimes to just get a completely different perspective on what's going on."
62;Speaker 2;00:45:48.590;00:45:57.920;00:00:09.330;"Can you give me an example of how you thought you found the advice from people outside of tech helpful for your project?"
63;Speaker 1;00:45:59.990;00:47:31.830;00:01:31.840;"Yeah. So thinking back to the project, I think just always knowing, knowing and being reminded of that there's so many ways to approach an issue that's not just the tech based solution. I think it's helpful. So I remember talking to people about some of the early interviews we could talk about that was a little bit easier to talk about without feeling like any pressure about the NDA, and that it was like, at the end of the day, this is like a bigger policy and environmental health question because Pittsburgh, it was like a lot of steel processing plants, a lot of manufacturing still happens. Well, ultimately the idea is to kind of have better regulation on these factories with the issues. So in a way, I think it's humbling in a way to have these perspectives, to kind of have a better because I think in working in an area that sometimes feels like it's so focused on novelty to be like, yeah, this is only dealing with this issue, perhaps barely even in this particular way, but how can it fit into this larger conversation? So I think that's kind of like what the outside perspective I see helps."
64;Speaker 2;00:47:31.890;00:47:48.760;00:00:16.870;"Then after you get the outside perspective, then does it influence your product at the end? Do you think that will make your final product more ethical or more concerned about social issues?"
65;Speaker 1;00:47:51.710;00:47:54.370;00:00:02.660;"Yeah, I don't know."
66;Speaker 2;00:47:54.550;00:47:56.250;00:00:01.700;"I'm just curious."
67;Speaker 1;00:47:57.170;00:49:31.160;00:01:33.990;"Yeah, in a way, I think it's helpful because then I remember once we did the financial calculations and everything, one of the things that turned out was at the time, I feel like the calculation for the product we made was like $600 in a way. You're like, wow, that's like a lot of money because when you factor in all the costs and everything. So it is like, well, there are people who spend that much money. They're usually like early adopters or people who are already into technology. So I think in terms of learning experience, that was a very like, okay, in this case, we followed user needs to a T, but then didn't necessarily prioritize cost as much because in a way that didn't really come up. I mean, it did come up, but we were also feeling pressured to make this novel prototype so this company would feel like they wanted to invest, continue working in smart tech style. So it's definitely like this pushed and pull that. I think for me at the time, it was like a good learning experience in thinking about how to Orient the process in a way that kind of influenced me doing my PhD because I was like, I don't think I can work in product size that much longer without feeling like I don't know what I'm doing."
68;Speaker 1;00:49:31.240;00:49:33.080;00:00:01.840;"In a way, I see."
69;Speaker 2;00:49:36.870;00:50:10.920;00:00:34.050;"Thank you for sharing your story. And then I will move on to the next slide. So I think you already mentioned from human support, for example, perspective from the outsider. But if you can't think about other people like friends, colleagues or family or crowd source worker who can help you with the process, then what kind of support do you want to get to maximize the efficiency of finding insights from qualitative data?"
70;Speaker 1;00:50:13.110;00:50:17.340;00:00:04.230;"Yeah. Do you want me to write or do you want me to do the same thing?"
71;Speaker 2;00:50:18.690;00:50:38.080;00:00:19.390;"Yes, do the same thing. Just copy paste the process. And also at this time, can you focus on finding Noble insights more efficiently by the help of these people?"
72;Speaker 1;00:50:39.490;00:50:55.040;00:00:15.550;"Yeah. I mean."
73;Speaker 2;00:50:57.170;00:50:59.060;00:00:01.890;"Let'S see all this. Right."
74;Speaker 1;00:50:59.870;00:52:53.350;00:01:53.480;"Human assistant. And I think one place that might be helpful is right here, kind of in the finding initial themes. Because as much as the qualitative coding process is supposed to help you with expanding all these insights and everything, there's sometimes like a tendency to stick with the first ideas you get. In my whole process of making and designing for many, many years, it's like sometimes that is a reaction to all the things that you've been seeing. But sometimes it is like sometimes I also wonder when you are kind of doing this process, perhaps collaboratively or something with another person, how that might also influence your thinking. Right. Let's see pretty much all of these. I guess I can see if you have a person depending I think it also could depend on their own interests or their own what level of participation they want. So I would think that a colleague would have a different set of skills or set of interest than a crowdsource worker in some sense. But I think like iterations on things and coding depending on the project, like being able to share early themes I always think is really important, like sharing work in progress."
75;Speaker 1;00:52:53.850;00:53:35.760;00:00:41.910;"I really have found a lot of help in especially. I mean, this is my shameless plug for Is seminar, but I think it's just like a really helpful way when you have because it can feel really vulnerable sometimes to just show new work. And so it's like a nice way to kind of be like here. Yeah. And I think with memos, sometimes like memos or have like, you're just like writing it for yourself, sometimes to kind of keep track. But then sometimes it's nice to have other people read your memos as well."
76;Speaker 2;00:53:37.170;00:53:47.710;00:00:10.540;"I see. Then when they reach your memo, do you think they need some access to raw data or do you think it's sufficient to just read over the memos?"
77;Speaker 1;00:53:48.870;00:54:18.780;00:00:29.910;"Yeah, sometimes my memos have raw data. So it has or it's like pulling quotes in. And so one of the things then that goes back into data collection and preparation, which I'm not very good at, is kind of de anonymizing things as you go along. So you already choose your aliases, you already choose everything. So that when you're doing your memos and you're starting to pull out quotes and things like that, it's already identified."
78;Speaker 2;00:54:18.930;00:55:15.920;00:00:56.990;"I see. Yeah. Thank you. Then the next slide is our last part of our interview. So in this page, can you copy paste the process once more? And then you can select where you might want to have some AI support to improve the quality and quantity of insights derived from qualitative data. Yeah. And if you go to the next page, I just put some examples of what AI can do, like shopping modeling. And the next one is like automatic taking and stuff. But you can think about other things too."
79;Speaker 1;00:55:16.730;00:57:13.600;00:01:56.870;"Yeah. I guess if there was some way to do like topic modeling, but like you could train the topic model so it's like more specified to your research questions or what you're doing. I can see that being helpful, like customizable topics, because sometimes it's like you can see like word frequency. But I think depending on the project, it can be very what you mean by certain terms might not translate to the potential topic model that is being implemented. So if there was a way to do more customizable things. So like to give you a brief example. The project I'm currently working on is about one of the very overarching themes of it is the work work show. So it's like in a way like that I can see like a topic model, like not be very helpful. And what you do need is a lot more context. You need a lot more specificity. So I guess that's like one way. So it's like topic modeling, but you're able to kind of tailor it in certain ways."
80;Speaker 2;00:57:13.740;00:57:22.610;00:00:08.870;"I see. Then I have a question. Yeah. From the tools that you're currently using, do they provide any topic monthly features?"
81;Speaker 1;00:57:27.230;00:58:03.460;00:00:36.230;"I don't think so. I don't think with Deduce, I remember we had tried using Atlas Ti for the web. So yeah, they have like a web version. It's currently in beta, I think. And we just stopped using it because they just didn't have a lot of functionalities. But one of the functionalities that they did have was sentiment analysis, which I thought was like a funny thing for them to prioritize, but it would basically run like a sentiment analysis on your field notes or on your interview transcripts."
82;Speaker 2;00:58:03.610;00:58:04.470;00:00:00.860;"I see."
83;Speaker 1;00:58:04.630;00:58:08.530;00:00:03.900;"But we never used it. This is like a funny."
84;Speaker 2;00:58:10.410;00:58:19.750;00:00:09.340;"Can I ask why you never used it? Like you didn't like the research or sentiment analysis wasn't just necessary for your analysis?"
85;Speaker 1;00:58:20.370;00:59:06.800;00:00:46.430;"Yeah, I would say sentiment analysis wasn't necessary. And in a certain way part of me didn't feel like I needed AI driven sentiment analysis to understand the sentiment of the meetings because I feel like we wrote notes to kind of capture because one of the things is in doing field notes, you do have things in your notes that talk about like someone said this and then everyone in the room stopped talking. Like there's always in a way that I think is much more textured than what the sentiment analysis can provide."
86;Speaker 2;00:59:07.190;00:59:08.120;00:00:00.930;"I see."
87;Speaker 1;00:59:08.570;00:59:09.320;00:00:00.750;"Yeah."
88;Speaker 2;00:59:11.450;00:59:19.160;00:00:07.710;"Okay. Is there any other AI technology that you want to incorporate into this process?"
89;Speaker 1;00:59:30.570;00:59:36.420;00:00:05.850;"I mean, I think the data collection and preparation. Yeah."
90;Speaker 2;00:59:37.710;00:59:54.780;00:00:17.070;"Well, you don't have to try to come up with an idea if you want to think of one. Then I'll ask about this customizable top remodeling. So you think it will be good if you can use it when you're finding the initial things?"
91;Speaker 1;00:59:56.490;01:00:41.040;00:00:44.550;"Yeah. Or I think maybe it's like something to use throughout to kind of like as your insights are changing, you can change the model in a way so it can be like an Iterative model that kind of so that you're more like you're using it as a tool versus one of the tools, like a way to kind of get ideas, especially if you feel like you're stuck. I think that's helpful. And for me, I think it would be more so of like a support tool that you can ignore if you don't think it's helpful at the moment, but then you can return to at any point in the process."
92;Speaker 2;01:00:41.670;01:01:01.630;00:00:19.960;"I see. Do you think then that type of topic modeling can help you to view data in a different perspective, like when you're stock or something or what do you think, like the potential benefit of, like, customizing the topic modeling?"
93;Speaker 1;01:01:02.790;01:01:53.790;00:00:51.000;"Yeah. I mean, I think in a way of seeing how it's choosing to, like, cluster certain words, how it's responding to the most basic word frequency. Technically that can be a helpful thing because in a way, it can validate or kind of challenge how you've been approaching your thinking. So I think any pushes that support or even work against it I think would be helpful. I know that sounds very vague, but I think just having different ways of looking at your data is helpful."
94;Speaker 2;01:01:54.290;01:02:09.080;00:00:14.790;"I see. Thank you so much. I think this is the end of our interview. Okay. I once again really appreciate your participation, and it was really nice to meet you."
95;Speaker 1;01:02:12.030;01:02:13.030;00:00:01.000;"Likewise."
96;Speaker 2;01:02:13.470;01:02:24.550;00:00:11.080;"Do you have any comments to improve this interview? Was there anything too difficult for you to come back or ambiguous?"
97;Speaker 1;01:02:24.930;01:03:07.240;00:00:42.310;"Yeah, I asked the clarification questions when I had questions. I think when it was like it was definitely felt more engaging when I was like, I'll just talk through this and putting it out, and I think that was helpful. I think the first one felt, like, hard to make, but when you asked me to just kind of copy and paste it into the next slides, it felt easier, but it's hard to do everything virtual. Yeah."
98;Speaker 2;01:03:08.350;01:03:09.520;00:00:01.170;"I get it."
99;Speaker 1;01:03:11.290;01:03:44.670;00:00:33.380;"If you know the pacing of your interviews, I think that's helpful. I know for sending out the form to fill out beforehand might save you time for like during the day because the form doesn't take that much time. It was just like when I was like one option could be for me to fill it out right before the interview. But that's just a small comment in terms of time saving time to talk to the person. Yeah, overall it was fun."
100;Speaker 2;01:03:44.850;01:03:45.370;00:00:00.520;"Yeah."
101;Speaker 1;01:03:45.470;01:03:46.360;00:00:00.890;"Thank you."
102;Speaker 2;01:03:48.430;01:03:49.720;00:00:01.290;"Thank you so much."
103;Speaker 1;01:03:50.110;01:03:53.200;00:00:03.090;"Yeah, no problem. Well, good luck with your study."
104;Speaker 2;01:03:53.890;01:04:01.060;00:00:07.170;"Thank you. Do you mind if I send a message on slide if I come up with additional questions?"
105;Speaker 1;01:04:01.570;01:04:04.180;00:00:02.610;"Yeah, of course. Thank you."
106;Speaker 2;01:04:04.930;01:04:07.200;00:00:02.270;"I hope you have a great day."
107;Speaker 1;01:04:07.400;01:04:20.490;00:00:13.090;"Thank you. You too. And hopefully I'll meet you in person at some point. Yeah, that would be so nice. Yeah. Have a good day. Bye. You too. Bye."
