0;Speaker 2;00:00:02.750;00:00:25.420;00:00:22.670;"So I see you ask questions about, I want to ask some more questions on the ethical design issues. Have you ever heard about the ethical design before?"
1;Speaker 1;00:00:26.890;00:00:28.060;00:00:01.170;"Ethical design?"
2;Speaker 2;00:00:28.200;00:00:34.120;00:00:05.920;"Yeah. I mean ethical issue on designing interfaces or whatever."
3;Speaker 1;00:00:36.890;00:00:41.480;00:00:04.590;"It's subcontent, but yeah, it's a part of it."
4;Speaker 2;00:00:44.070;00:00:47.220;00:00:03.150;"Can you tell me more specific in your home?"
5;Speaker 1;00:00:48.270;00:02:08.199;00:01:19.929;"There are a lot of different layers to that question. Okay. First of all, no matter if it's art or design, it needs to be respectful. Which means, for example there are a lot of bad ads in the 18th century or even 19th century about subjective female like female is not being respected. So those are the design really bad for respect. Women or women look like they stay at home mom all the time rather than give them a chance to work and accept education. And now I think it's over to human right now. We have raised issue in the past few years about Black Lives Matter and Asian thing going on last year. Of course, right now we have the world and then throughout the functionality. And there are two part in the UI UX, which one is the delight moment of making interactions like easy to use, making emotional positive sign. The second is straightforward to make a function. That's what you mentioned about ethical design. That's to my understanding of it."
6;Speaker 2;00:02:08.830;00:03:10.590;00:01:01.759;"Okay. Yeah, I think that is also what I extended. And also to be more stressful for me, ethical design means, for example the Facebook. So Facebook has so many ethical issues these days when developing their UX user interface design. So for example, sometimes they hide some information from the other users and also they do not provide the right to control their Privacy issues. And also sometimes they design their user interfaces like some hard too difficult to find some information. So this is kind of the unethical design cases. So do you have any thought about this as a US designer?"
7;Speaker 1;00:03:13.350;00:04:22.300;00:01:08.950;"It is not just a designer's thought on the product direction. It is very majority determined by the product owner or whoever is the product manager on decision which you take. And it's a very strategical question because you need to not think. I don't think it's a conflict between ethic and the profit, but it's a conflict sometime with the Ethic to the easier of useless. So a quick example, we need to ask a user to check opt in and then agree with the term of use and agree with the cookie to collect data with Google and especially after California have this new code issue then previously we don't put that as a priority because user doesn't want it to read it. None of the user would want it to read one full page of text."
8;Speaker 2;00:04:23.230;00:04:24.070;00:00:00.840;"I got it."
9;Speaker 1;00:04:24.170;00:05:02.020;00:00:37.850;"Majority of the user they are user wanted to read it, we leave a chance to them. But those are really minor against the whole product. So a lot of the applicable design in such a term, it is really to cater for majority of the user and what's the value to them? The common ground of agreement rather than we're going to make every single person happy. We have one complaint because he couldn't find the term of use. So he needs to change the design for the product which you are facing too many of other users. It doesn't work that way."
10;Speaker 2;00:05:05.770;00:05:36.320;00:00:30.550;"Okay, cool. So do you have any special personal experience on design cases when you develop some interfaces? So what? I mean, when you design the interfaces, do you think about ethical issues or cases when you develop your product?"
11;Speaker 1;00:05:39.990;00:05:45.230;00:00:05.240;"What do you mean by ethical in terms of designing a product? Like give me some example."
12;Speaker 2;00:05:45.410;00:06:40.350;00:00:54.940;"Okay. So when you develop some something product so you think about some social impact on your services. So for example, the Twitter is intented to share some information with a very short amount of the sentence. But later the many people views these Twitters like blame each other or whatever. So something like that. But I believe that the designer cannot understand this kind of situation before when they develop interfaces. But I just wonder when designers develop some interfaces they also think about this kind of scenario or cases related social impact or some ethical cases."
13;Speaker 1;00:06:42.470;00:06:58.810;00:00:16.340;"I think. Let me ask you a question. Do you think building a regulation for ethics to rule people is going to help people to get a better Ethic overall?"
14;Speaker 2;00:07:09.790;00:07:22.340;00:00:12.550;"Okay, yes, sorry. I think she's one of our researchers. So she's doing this interview."
15;Speaker 1;00:07:22.490;00:07:23.380;00:00:00.890;"Nice to meet you."
16;Speaker 3;00:07:23.460;00:07:49.230;00:00:25.770;"Nice to meet you. Thank you for participating the interview. To answer your question, I think it's not always good to regulate people, especially on ethical side. But still there are some people who do something that we cannot understand with common sense. So in those cases maybe regulations are required."
17;Speaker 1;00:07:53.010;00:09:26.650;00:01:33.640;"I think it's a very good scenario in United States because it's a country with a full of immigrant. Only a small amount of people are actually originally from here, right. Everyone else immigrant in different ways. Ethical is very different to different background on the country, the religion, the education you've got and also the family surrounding impact. Also friendship. The common agreement of Ethic is only a star from you to other people and the surroundings. That's why it's really hard to draw a line for Ethic. And I think legal rule people what is good and bad. Just saying you cannot kill people, it's bad. Ethic is talking about what is the right thing to do and what is right to you and what is right to me it could be very different. So from that perspective, for all the products have created, I believe for people who are entrepreneur or startup or project owner wanting to start a project, they're emphasized to make this work better. Google does it, Apple does it, even Facebook initially with a matter verse. The motion is to make the better world for every single one. But when it comes down to ethics, is it a right thing for them on the Ethic?"
18;Speaker 1;00:09:26.700;00:10:50.410;00:01:23.710;"And is that right thing for the designer or for the product manager or even developer? It's different because we cannot draw a clear line. What is right to do so in consideration, what is right to ethical design? I can say. I believe this is the value I represent. I believe this is what I should present. For example, a very obvious case, if you look at all the images has been utilized for the website, that's for marketing purpose, right? Not for UI UX. You can swap that image. You see more black Asian curvy woman nowadays. Back then, we see what Victoria's Secret was in long leg, right? So now the attic change because a certain undertone of the society change ethic is moving part. And the product is a living creature too. What I believe to utilize for ethic. We love to use dog, kids and animals in any of the products because we agree ethically, they are cute, we like them. But maybe someday some kind of influence could happen that people that doesn't believe that and can prevent that. So from the respectful value, that's unethical."
19;Speaker 3;00:10:51.750;00:11:00.120;00:00:08.370;"I understand. Yeah. Thank you for your answer. Hunter, do you have any more ethic related questions?"
20;Speaker 2;00:11:05.050;00:11:09.040;00:00:03.990;"Maybe now you can take your part to ask her."
21;Speaker 3;00:11:09.550;00:11:10.300;00:00:00.750;"Okay."
22;Speaker 2;00:11:10.990;00:11:14.610;00:00:03.620;"I think before that we should share from the Google slide."
23;Speaker 3;00:11:14.790;00:11:53.140;00:00:38.350;"Yes. So this interview is comprised of like two parts. One part. We already did the first part when we asked about ethics and design. And the second part is about trying to understand how UX designers in the industry conduct quality to data analysis. And for this, we're going to do a little work workshop and I'm going to share a Google slide where you can do some exercises with us. So I'm just going to share the link on the chat and let me know if you can access it."
24;Speaker 1;00:11:56.450;00:11:58.300;00:00:01.850;"Yes, I am on it now."
25;Speaker 3;00:11:58.380;00:13:06.320;00:01:07.940;"Oh, thank you. Okay, then let's get started. So the first part, we're going to ask some general questions to understand the context in the industry setting. Okay. So the first exercise is we're going to ask you to draw a diagram that can represent a very usual process your team take when developing a product. And this is an example from our previous participant. And you can create like any diagram based on your own experience. And we provided these little colored dots. And these dots represent like different type of collaborators. Also, when you're making a diagram, please include qualitative data analysis elements and brainstorming stage so we can know where they are located in this whole process. So if you go to page three. Yeah, you already copy pasted so you can modify it. And while you're making it, can you talk through and explain how each process works? In your experience."
26;Speaker 1;00:13:08.910;00:13:10.980;00:00:02.070;"Okay, let me break the chart."
27;Speaker 3;00:13:11.130;00:13:13.020;00:00:01.890;"Okay. Sure. Go ahead."
28;Speaker 1;00:13:23.290;00:14:48.420;00:01:25.130;"So normally it starts with a brainstorming and the brainstorming session is based on the strategy. So not everyone will participate. It's more, I think business and data science. Well, I don't think data science are part of that. It's more of business. And they start with a consider what is the direction to take to meet the goal of the company in terms of either increasing user increasing probability or making better engagement for people. And it's both user quantitative research. Oh, that's user test. Okay. Yeah. So both qualitative and quantitative user research, sometimes it doesn't happen the way sometimes you don't need user research because it was a strategy decision. But it could have happened. It could have been. And then it will go normally I would just say more linear way of a design prototype of how to make that happen. And in that way over here, I think we might need UX researcher and the product manager, which I don't see."
29;Speaker 3;00:14:48.990;00:14:53.160;00:00:04.170;"You can add product manager if you think it's important."
30;Speaker 1;00:14:53.610;00:15:38.950;00:00:45.340;"Product manager is very important. I don't know. Let me add a purple. And then after the design prototypes. Normally, what is the reason to separate UX researcher and UI designer?"
31;Speaker 3;00:15:40.650;00:15:55.910;00:00:15.260;"I think in some team they just have separate roles. So that's why I just separated them. But if you think they are like the same role, then you can just combine them together. Okay."
32;Speaker 1;00:15:56.030;00:16:37.660;00:00:41.630;"Let me rename over here, because I would call it product researcher and the product designer. And the reason why is UI and UX are two different mindset. And you kind of need both UI and UX as design and also for the product researcher. They do not only focus on UI or UX, they're focusing on the full product. So they need to understand a marketing strategy. They need to have the research method on the knowledge to conduct. So I wouldn't separate one route to each category. I would say both of them should cooperate together."
33;Speaker 3;00:16:38.350;00:16:39.340;00:00:00.990;"I see."
34;Speaker 1;00:16:40.630;00:19:04.670;00:02:24.040;"So let me do that. So product manager and the product researcher would do the user research and after that the designer and the product manager would work on the prototype. And after the prototype, there isn't other steps is the presentation idea review. So the data signed. The product manager and product designer would review together how the concept is visible. Can we get the data? Is the timeline working? And then after that it will be development. So the development would be more again, I wouldn't say data scientist. I would say it's more for front end, back end developers. It's more of the front end back end developers with the data scientists and also the product designer because they need to review. Well, actually product designer and product owner. And after that we release the spring, we collect data in a Ga. And after the Ga evaluation, generating product designer and a product manager and the researcher would be evaluating? No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I think they're more on the end of the loop. How do I make an arrow with those boxes?"
35;Speaker 3;00:19:05.230;00:19:06.710;00:00:01.480;"I'll add arrow."
36;Speaker 1;00:19:08.530;00:19:09.290;00:00:00.760;"I got it."
37;Speaker 3;00:19:09.340;00:19:10.480;00:00:01.140;"Okay. I saw it."
38;Speaker 1;00:19:11.110;00:19:15.690;00:00:04.580;"Sorry. It's not going to be. It's looking very weird right now."
39;Speaker 3;00:19:15.870;00:19:18.280;00:00:02.410;"It's okay. Don't worry about how it looks."
40;Speaker 1;00:19:37.190;00:19:47.670;00:00:10.480;"Development, then release and then you do user testing and then you do evaluation."
41;Speaker 3;00:19:50.190;00:20:10.570;00:00:20.380;"Thank you. I came up with some questions based on your diagram. You said the first user research sometimes happens and sometimes it doesn't. And why do you think sometimes it doesn't?"
42;Speaker 1;00:20:11.190;00:20:34.820;00:00:23.630;"It really depends on the feature. If it's a feature that matters or innovative, then you need to do research on hypothesis, basically to get a second opinion of that direction. But if it's a micro change, then you really don't need to like you need to add another button, right? You don't need to handle that. It really depends on the skill of the project."
43;Speaker 3;00:20:34.900;00:20:47.270;00:00:12.370;"I see. So then the second user test will be mostly focused on testing features."
44;Speaker 1;00:20:49.510;00:20:50.260;00:00:00.750;"Okay."
45;Speaker 3;00:20:52.390;00:21:03.650;00:00:11.260;"So at the second user study, does coming up with innovative ideas also important or is it mostly focused on testing the usability?"
46;Speaker 1;00:21:05.710;00:21:55.960;00:00:50.250;"Do you mean the user? Yes, that's more usability and feedback because there is always happening that design development could be a bit different. Like something in designers mind does work this way. When you run into development, it could be different because for example, the data is not available, the development code takes longer, which they need to take like one step further. So with all the barriers the user testing post it's. Either you look at Ga on their interaction or you actually conduct research. But research is a very time consuming thing to do. Not our company can afford to do the research all the time."
47;Speaker 3;00:21:58.310;00:22:36.630;00:00:38.320;"Okay then. Thank you for your answer. Let's move on to the second exercise. So from the second exercise, we're going to focus on to know whether there are some pain points during this process. So you can copy your diagram that you made on the third page and then paste it on the fifth page and then Mark with this red lightning symbol to indicate where do you find within this process challenging? And while you do that, please elaborate verbally. Why do you think these moments are challenging?"
48;Speaker 1;00:22:58.050;00:23:06.370;00:00:08.320;"Brainstorming is the most difficult part because there could be a zillion different ideas, right."
49;Speaker 3;00:23:06.540;00:23:07.260;00:00:00.720;"So."
50;Speaker 1;00:23:09.330;00:24:48.110;00:01:38.780;"To align people to agree on the strategy, especially nowadays, it's not just a talk like if it's a big feature, it's not just a talk between the Co and the CTO. It's normally like a CEO, whoever is responding director of the project. And if it's aligned with the investor and also the board of member. So it's more difficult conversation from that point of view. Okay, so I think that's definitely difficult because not all the ideas get you deployed at the end they can only select one invest like you have a million dollar. How you're going to chop that million dollar to investing? Things matters. And what do you think matters to the company and to the user and to your product? So that's very difficult. And user research normally is not difficult. We use platform like UserTesting.com, Mterx, Quadric. Yeah, they already have their recruiting system, so it's not difficult at all. Prototyping is not difficult, at least to me. I don't know, maybe it could be different projects and normally just go to the product design method, do research, think in creative and normally you present two to three versions. One is the version based on the requirement."
51;Speaker 1;00:24:48.160;00:26:17.890;00:01:29.730;"You meet the requirement and the version. You look at a competitor, how they're doing and elaborate all the innovative version. And normally the innovative version doesn't get to develop because it's too risky. You don't have a data and sometime after the prototype has been done, there would be a user research happening between for example, we put a Sigma prototype on UserTesting.com and just to ask people's opinion first impression, what do you think each function does? So yeah, it's not difficult. Concept review is not. I think development and also evaluation are difficult because development they need to firstly really think what data they can get and how to create algorithm to make sure what they're presenting is accurate and aligned. And if you are not representing something accurately, then you're hurting the trustability and also the intention of the product. So I definitely think development is very important. The second round of user testing, again, it depends on like if you want to do a balance or AP test. However that's being consistently existed for the product evaluation is very difficult again because once you have this concept, you come to evaluation. You need to make sure that the continuation of the project once you release it's, not just a set in stone."
52;Speaker 1;00:26:17.960;00:26:31.850;00:00:13.890;"Once it's released, you need to think about the future of the same functionality to expand it. Maybe you have a button here as the first step and then you might have a chart and they might have a graphic, you might have click. So you need to continue creating."
53;Speaker 3;00:26:38.210;00:27:18.130;00:00:39.920;"Interesting, I understand the pain points that you mentioned during the evaluation and iteration stage. Are there some cases that you actually researcher? For example, in this case product researchers are involved in evaluating the product and also at the beginning when at the brainstorming stage you mentioned only business related people are involved. Are there some cases that product manager like researchers also involved in both of the stages?"
54;Speaker 1;00:27:22.510;00:27:53.980;00:00:31.470;"It could be from the hierarchy level. So for example, if you need to do a rebranding project among your website, everyone already know that's a decision made, then the brainstorming would involve with a lot of user research. I see. Yeah, those questions are very specific to specific scenario so it's like really I can't say yes or no or it has to be within the scenario within the case of what the project."
55;Speaker 3;00:27:56.930;00:28:27.170;00:00:30.240;"Okay, so as far as I understood, when the project is began at the very early stage where you need to analyze the market and decide like strategy, how you're going to develop the product and mainly business related people are involved at the beginning. But when you are rebranding the preexisting website or services then product researchers are also involved at an Allstate."
56;Speaker 1;00:28:27.360;00:28:41.360;00:00:14.000;"Our researcher within my current company has the exact title as well and she participated in different research not just for product but also for brand, for trustability among all."
57;Speaker 3;00:28:42.470;00:28:48.030;00:00:05.560;"I see. I'm just curious, how do you like researchability of the brand?"
58;Speaker 1;00:28:48.830;00:29:01.950;00:00:13.120;"Very interesting question. You scale measurable questions with both quantities so it has to be mixed method. It cannot be just qualitative or quantitative."
59;Speaker 3;00:29:02.120;00:29:02.670;00:00:00.550;"Okay."
60;Speaker 1;00:29:02.780;00:29:59.850;00:00:57.070;"And the previous research has done a lot. So if you go to like academia research, there are a lot of usability test skill that people have been tested and it's working. You take those questions, you make changes and alteration to those questions that fit your brand and you test it from different aspects. So you might be testing trustability but you also want to test security. The visual presentation, are they clean, are they functioning? Are you likely to use this site in the future? Are you likely to share this site with your friend? So it's a mixed method of I would say like taking the main value of their scale rating for a different aspect and then through the interview of their machining."
61;Speaker 3;00:30:01.010;00:30:13.650;00:00:12.640;"I see then in your company that I guess like product researchers should be able to conduct both by quantitative and qualitative methods."
62;Speaker 1;00:30:13.820;00:30:40.100;00:00:26.280;"Yeah, I think all the product researchers should have that because if it's an interview like this interview, you will need to code what I said. For us, we need to code what word was mentioned the most and what are the questions that be interesting and valuable to the study. So it's the same thing. Like to us, if a lot of people think security is the most important thing which we are lacking off, then we need to work on design for security."
63;Speaker 3;00:30:43.170;00:30:49.310;00:00:06.140;"I see. Thank you for your answer. Let's move on to number three."
64;Speaker 1;00:30:49.490;00:30:49.980;00:00:00.490;"Okay."
65;Speaker 3;00:30:50.060;00:31:46.680;00:00:56.620;"So in this case we're going to focus on brainstorming when different stakeholders are making decisions. So for example, you can consider these questions at the third exercise like what is the definition of good insight for UX researcher and how different stakeholders think differently and who makes decision at the end and how do you choose the best idea that fit different stakeholders needs? So it will be great if you can give us an example of deciding good insight between these different stakeholders. You already mentioned at the early stage, brainstorming is very challenging. So can you elaborate that brainstorming a part."
66;Speaker 1;00:31:48.870;00:33:21.590;00:01:32.720;"People have different mind. So I give you a question as investor saying I want to make sure we increase the user engagement and bounce rate for the next quarter, which next three months, okay. And I wanted to increase the new user of sign up for 20%. So this is a measurable goal, this is what everyone's driving for. And then you break down that goal into different products section. So for example, for website, you might have a sign up page, you might have a landing page, you have a marketing team you have already like in the platform user, you have different funnel to attract user, basically. So break down that goal to different users saying hey, you need to increase new user for 10% and for the already in platform user, you need to try to help them to invite new user. I don't know, give them a budget or give them the incentive, a Starbucks copy by invite a friend and then break down that goal. Then each set of that product will need to be coming up with a solution. So the product owner for attracting new user, he needs to think with the designer what are the ways they can do on the current platform, based on the framework, based on the timeline, based on the budget they can do to meet that goal."
67;Speaker 3;00:33:21.970;00:33:22.850;00:00:00.880;"I see."
68;Speaker 1;00:33:23.020;00:33:49.240;00:00:26.220;"And everyone has a different opinion sometimes. For example, I want to track a new user. I think giving a marketing campaign would be the best. But different people might think differently, they might think oh, we should do more Google ads, we should do more Facebook ads, we should do better design, we should do better content. So it's difficult because the nature of multiple ways of solving the same problem."
69;Speaker 3;00:33:50.770;00:34:00.050;00:00:09.280;"I see them in this case who like choose the method that you guys should use to achieve the goal."
70;Speaker 1;00:34:00.670;00:35:15.580;00:01:14.910;"So it normally would put into a presentation and every team or every product manager would come with a list of what they can do and based on what they can do, they filter three times. The first time they filter by visibility. Sometimes you could have a crazy amazing idea. Beautiful, great. We don't have people but we don't have the timeline. So it cannot be done, it cannot be prioritized. And then they feature the second time based on the investment of for example, we wanted to get this data from Google Maps but it's very expensive and the budget might not be visible, it might be a barrier to develop that. Then the third time is all the leftover idea they prioritize based on what can attract users the most. And it's pretty common. Understandable. For example, if you do a great landing page, it's easy to attract user. Or if you do a marketing campaign with a business partner, it's easy to attract user. But if you just go to Google and set up the ad, it's very low rate, the conversion rate is very low. It's just a natural of what we would take. I see."
71;Speaker 1;00:35:15.720;00:35:24.640;00:00:08.920;"Yeah. You filter and then you filter again and then you prioritize. And based on the prioritization, you make decision on what needs to be put in line."
72;Speaker 3;00:35:25.870;00:35:48.560;00:00:22.690;"I see. Okay, then I think in this case, when you're updating the preexisting service, maybe you guys can go through these three steps to choose the best idea part of."
73;Speaker 1;00:35:48.700;00:35:51.740;00:00:03.040;"Do you want me to make a copy on the slide six?"
74;Speaker 3;00:35:55.650;00:36:07.990;00:00:12.340;"Yes, please. Okay. But I think in this case maybe we don't need to do anything. Maybe I will change the color of the brainstorming stage into like yellow."
75;Speaker 1;00:36:08.790;00:36:09.540;00:00:00.750;"Okay."
76;Speaker 3;00:36:15.730;00:36:33.590;00:00:17.860;"Can I ask additional question about this third exercise? Do you think going through the three steps to filter out and take the best insight also applied to the scenario when you're developing a new product from the script?"
77;Speaker 1;00:36:35.590;00:36:37.660;00:00:02.070;"In my opinion, it's different."
78;Speaker 3;00:36:39.850;00:36:42.460;00:00:02.610;"Can you tell me why do you think it's different?"
79;Speaker 1;00:36:43.810;00:38:10.000;00:01:26.190;"Because we're talking about the scenario in more of small or already funded startup. Like you already kind of have a product. But if you go in aside from one to 100 steps right now, if we're talking from zero to one, then you're driven by, for example, want to do something innovative. The competitors research is only a comparison of functionality, how they have done and finding the Breakpoint, the weak point, the weakness to innovate. And we are innovating something. It takes a really long time for users and for people to accept. So if you're trying to do a new product, testing wouldn't be working because you don't have user right and user survey, you can only help utilize user survey or user research to validate your point of view of the solution, but you cannot utilize them to validate your product design at that stage. And anything could go wrong. Doing the product design, product development because of the resource. The liking resource. So your hypothesis might have really good goal, but because of the resource or liking resource, you might not meet that goal at the end, even through your evaluation could take a long time."
80;Speaker 1;00:38:10.020;00:38:16.850;00:00:06.830;"That's why a lot of start ups fell at the early stage, like 90% or something as a failure."
81;Speaker 3;00:38:18.550;00:38:39.760;00:00:21.210;"That's interesting. Then I have a question. Why do you think 10% of startups make success when 90% fail to go through this hardship? Do you think they have different strategies they take to come up with innovative product?"
82;Speaker 1;00:38:42.010;00:38:52.350;00:00:10.340;"That's a very large question that everyone start up trying to figure out. So I don't think I have the best answer for it."
83;Speaker 3;00:38:52.530;00:38:53.050;00:00:00.520;"Right."
84;Speaker 1;00:38:53.150;00:39:46.400;00:00:53.250;"But there are always three things to think about. A good thing happens. It's really depending on the right people, right time, right place, and right opportunity. We could call it lock, but lock is like the prepared to accept that moment. It's called lock. Lock is everywhere. Right? Right. So I think it's not just a designer or a product manager couldn't answer that. It's the right people. They're meeting together, they have great idea. They agree with each other. Start that project. Right investment, right resource at right time. Because for example, during the Colbert 19, what we need is we need the masks. Whoever has the capability of producing mass and logistics, we can ship it has the most profit potential, or they can help the most people."
85;Speaker 3;00:39:47.390;00:39:48.140;00:00:00.750;"Right."
86;Speaker 1;00:39:48.770;00:40:04.410;00:00:15.640;"They fell not because they had raw people, they had a great, amazing talent, they had a great resource, but they did not prepare for making math. They might be doing something else. So it's really the comprehensive of the scenario."
87;Speaker 3;00:40:05.270;00:40:21.070;00:00:15.800;"I see you mentioned right people. Do you think there are some people who can help to bring like great ideas? Then what are the qualities of these right people? In your opinion."
88;Speaker 1;00:40:23.470;00:41:09.580;00:00:46.110;"What is the right friend? It's the same question. If people believe in the same value as you and they believe in the product as you and they're willing to take risks and make decisions for the right choice, you would definitely have people when you're hiring them, they just want to get tested on and tell them what to do. They do exactly what they ask for. Great, wonderful. Those are great people to have. When you have the right people, they think beyond and above. They think for you and they create a product that you've never thought of. But during a brainstorm, those are the people bringing ideas to make that happen. You ask the question, they give you three solution rather than one."
89;Speaker 3;00:41:10.750;00:41:24.250;00:00:13.500;"I see that's true. I think it will be really difficult to find yourself motivated and full of ideas. People who are full of ideas, it's very difficult."
90;Speaker 1;00:41:24.410;00:41:27.340;00:00:02.930;"And they need to have the skill to make the work done."
91;Speaker 3;00:41:27.910;00:41:33.580;00:00:05.670;"Right. Thank you. Then let's move on to part two."
92;Speaker 1;00:41:33.720;00:41:34.420;00:00:00.700;"Okay."
93;Speaker 3;00:41:35.350;00:42:13.890;00:00:38.540;"So in this stage, we're going to focus on qualitative data analysis. So from the part one, you made a diagram for the general product development process. But in here you're going to make a diagram how use your Qualitative data analysis goes in your company so you can copy paste the example from the page nine and can modify it. Also, please elaborate or talk through why you make this diagram."
94;Speaker 1;00:42:19.950;00:43:24.240;00:01:04.290;"At this stage, we're utilizing Qualitative interview from UserTesting.com, large platform, 30,000 people, different country, different language, different income, pretty good. It doesn't represent the mass majority. It's only 300 people. Right. But those people can give because they are skilled about rating. So they need to give a very factual opinion in order to get a good rating. So overall, it's being a working platform to what we need. Do we conduct user research? We do because we have customer service Department. And when customer service is talking to customers, they are conducting surveys as well. At the same time, those clients might be also talking during the conversation, complaints or whatever. As a part, but it's always very narrow because you don't see the full picture ever. You cannot conduct the full platform with a full qualitative or quantitative user research."
95;Speaker 3;00:43:25.290;00:43:26.160;00:00:00.870;"I see."
96;Speaker 1;00:43:30.190;00:43:45.670;00:00:15.480;"Yeah, those go together. I agree. I think this also goes together. Maybe I have a different understanding of memory."
97;Speaker 3;00:43:50.170;00:43:50.530;00:00:00.360;"Yeah."
98;Speaker 1;00:43:50.570;00:45:37.630;00:01:47.060;"Prepare for research takes longer than the research itself. So finding initial theme is like, for example, we wanted to research on whether the calculator on the website works right, if that's the right value or if we're calculating it, making contribution to the user's experience. So you have a theme and then when you collect data collection preparation, I think this should be separate because data collection data preparation is definitely not together. So you prepare the first. For example, you filter down Pres graining, gender, country, language, age, income, whatever. Then you might do some memory on the question. Let me change it. I would have saved set up question questions to ask, and that gets reviewed several times for the setup question because you need to make sure you're asking the right question to not misleading people and then to be very accurate to what you're measuring a lot of time, like measuring trust. What are the keywords related to trust, how people measure them? Like you said, it's a difficult or it's not very easy to do. So this three goes together and then after that you set after that, what do we do? That's a quoting that's after taking notes over here presentation."
99;Speaker 1;00:45:37.690;00:47:42.960;00:02:05.270;"Yeah, that's at the end for sure. So after that you set up select questions and then you set up questions. And of course, it would do like sometime when it's a big project, you do a pilot test as well to make sure you are asking the right question. You can find a good people. And then you click on a test and then you collect data, and then you collect data. Once you collect data, you quote the data, you watch video and code it and test on like positive and negative feedback and then iteration to the theme and coding. Maybe that at the very end put in the presentation format. So you quoted the data and you analysis against the hypothesis and then you put in two presentation format. You have to keep a conclusion. So you give a conclusion and then you discuss putting the presentation format to the team to let them to review and give feedback. And yeah, if you want, you can always do the future research on the theme and the coding. But let me just leave that for now."
100;Speaker 3;00:47:44.070;00:48:16.740;00:00:32.670;"Thank you. I think it goes through a very detailed process compared to my other previous participants because they sometimes mentioned that I don't have enough time to actually go through raw data and do some qualitative coding. So they just made conclusion based on the note they took on the user study they conducted. So do you think in your company. You have enough time and resources to go through this whole process."
101;Speaker 1;00:48:17.790;00:49:42.710;00:01:24.920;"It could be challenging, but it's not that difficult to get it down. User testing made it very easy. Like on user testing, when you get the data on the left side you have like video. And on the right side you have a coding panel. And then for one video, like we have 15. Normally it's like a set of 15 people and then they have videos ran around like ten minutes to 15 minutes. You can speed up if you wanted to read it faster. Some people speak really slow and then as you're watching the video, you have like different lines of quoting it. So you can have different boxes and they have timestamp and they have like positive and negative kind of thing. So on the right side you just quoted if you're looking at the slide I made. So on the right side, this is where you make code. And normally we have two people quote on one participant. You can match what they agree to make, like the error to eliminate the error. But yeah, if without timing, just one people. Like if the team of 03:00 p.m. Marketing or the product would go together like a code of four, like everyone watch five videos coded, and then at the end you can download a spreadsheet and the spreadsheet would have a certain comment line up to against you the question."
102;Speaker 1;00:49:42.890;00:50:00.610;00:00:17.720;"And for each question you would have 15 answers. And if they're outrating the 15 answer, you would have find a common kind of direction to go and you give a conclusion and then we put that conclusion to presentation format with their user interface. It wasn't difficult. It wasn't very time consuming."
103;Speaker 3;00:50:02.190;00:50:07.930;00:00:05.740;"Can you let me know the software, the tool that you use for qualitative coding."
104;Speaker 1;00:50:10.450;00:50:13.850;00:00:03.400;"That you just mentioned, the user testing?"
105;Speaker 3;00:50:15.410;00:51:00.340;00:00:44.930;"No, like the software that you just drew. So you use like UserTesting.com for. Also, I have another question. Many of my participants mentioned that they find it difficult to recruit participants for the user study from the outside of the company because they don't want to spill their company secret. But in your case, you are using some UserTesting.com and you mentioned you're recruiting people from a variety of backgrounds. So why do you think it's possible in your case?"
106;Speaker 1;00:51:01.390;00:51:16.480;00:00:15.090;"Because they handle the recruit. Like, we pay them $10,000 per year and they handle the recruiting. We don't handle the recruiting. And from the moment we publish a study, the data can be reading within a day or two."
107;Speaker 3;00:51:17.950;00:51:18.770;00:00:00.820;"I see."
108;Speaker 1;00:51:18.880;00:51:23.200;00:00:04.320;"So it wasn't on our task to recruit participant. We don't have to do that."
109;Speaker 3;00:51:23.890;00:51:56.370;00:00:32.480;"I see. Ok. Thank you for your answer. Let's move on to exercise two. So in this exercise, you can do the similar thing that we did from the part one, you can copy paste your diagram that you made and also put this red lightning symbols on the steps that you find challenging and let us know why do you think it's challenging?"
110;Speaker 1;00:51:58.250;00:52:24.020;00:00:25.770;"Okay. I think both data preparation and set up questions are difficult because again this is a very person to person different. If I wanted to research what is the Asian married female filling against to the product in trustability, that's like very narrow study."
111;Speaker 3;00:52:24.220;00:52:24.830;00:00:00.610;"Yeah."
112;Speaker 1;00:52:24.950;00:53:50.780;00:01:25.830;"And then once we set that then people would start to ask within the team why has to be Asian female, why cannot be Asian male? Why cannot be black male? Why cannot be other ethnicity? So data preparation takes a lot of internal energy to review and agree. For example, I think trustability and secure is in relation. People might not agree, they feel security is a technical issue, it's not a trustability issue. So we need to align our mind first and that takes a lot of time to communicate and convince. And there's also within a company you have a hierarchy of the business with the manager who is assistant. The system might have a better opinion but the manager has a vine voice, right. That's when we speak out like we share opinion but it doesn't mean the right opinion gets pushed because whoever has authority might make decision based on their understanding at the end, which is more management situation. And then for selecting question the exact same thing. Like I might think we should ask different words, let them express three words of impression or to align with what we wanted to present. And people might think oh I should ask this one first or I think we should ask ten words rather than three words."
113;Speaker 1;00:53:50.920;00:55:21.110;00:01:30.190;"So lining those is very time consuming because we use that platform. Set up questioning a platform doesn't take a moment. Pilot testing doesn't take moments. It's internally review. Collecting data really doesn't take like I said, one to two days, then the videos are ready to watch and then the coding and analyzing the coding, not saying difficult or not pinpoint, but just by standing the point of view as a product owner or the researcher, you need to make sure people are coding it without putting themselves in a scenario. Because coding can be very subjective. Like how I code into positive might be different. People might think that's a negative, right, right. So it's a very blurred line and coding need to be aligned and then analyzing the coding at the end you have all the scripts putting together. You find a common area and give a definition. Some people might feel stronger towards certain word and some people might feel less stronger to certain word and the conclusion. Normally in general setting it's not difficult to come agree but in certain part people could be arguing about. I think the overall study contributes to the hypothesis and some people might think it's not very significant because our keywords wasn't mentioned."
114;Speaker 1;00:55:21.230;00:55:26.660;00:00:05.430;"So yeah, it's research method. I think it's not a team collaboration thing."
115;Speaker 3;00:55:26.860;00:56:10.870;00:00:44.010;"I see. Thank you. Then let's move on to third exercise. In this exercise you can think about like tools I use on each stage and let us know what do you think are the pros and cons of the tools that you use? For example, you mentioned the userstudy.com and you can tell us cons of that website. And also maybe you can talk about the tools they use for qualitative coding and analyzing the coding. And if you guys take another strategy other than using the tool to come up with more better insights."
116;Speaker 1;00:56:12.030;00:56:51.420;00:00:39.390;"Can you show us how to use the tool to generate insights from your data? Let me think. Give me a moment. Okay. Maybe this would be very helpful. So you wanted me to copy this over, right?"
117;Speaker 3;00:56:51.870;00:56:52.620;00:00:00.750;"Yes."
118;Speaker 1;00:56:53.130;00:56:58.930;00:00:05.800;"And then copy it over. And then for Egypt set up a goal."
119;Speaker 3;00:56:59.730;00:57:22.680;00:00:22.950;"Yeah. Maybe you can also copy this post it box and think about to answer these questions. But you don't have to go over all the stages. I think it would be beneficial if we can focus on like injusting insights part like generating insights and analyzing code."
120;Speaker 1;00:57:24.870;00:57:33.340;00:00:08.470;"Finish coding modified code efficient for each step or for the coding step."
121;Speaker 3;00:57:34.510;00:57:48.590;00:00:14.080;"Maybe we can focus on the coding step and after the coding when you come up with ideas and grouping ideas or making a theme general theme."
122;Speaker 1;00:57:52.550;00:58:36.730;00:00:44.180;"Okay. Why is still helping you to achieve a goal compared to other easy to code and why our elimination time and other strategies to achieve the goal? Yeah. Increase reliability which is. I agree, increase reliability and concrete."
123;Speaker 3;00:58:44.650;00:59:20.130;00:00:35.480;"Thank you. Actually we have part three left and it's been like already an hour. So I think it would take maybe around ten minutes to finish this whole exercise. Do you mind if we conduct this interview for ten more minutes? Okay. Thank you. Did you just attach an example of that software?"
124;Speaker 1;00:59:20.300;00:59:20.740;00:00:00.440;"Yeah."
125;Speaker 3;00:59:20.820;01:00:41.120;00:01:20.300;"That's how they are. Okay, let's move on to part three in this stage. Based on the diagram that you made at the part two, can you think about because of the time limit? Let's go to page 18. Okay. So from the previous diagram there was a part when you have to code and come up with ideas. And from this exercise, our previous participant made more detailed process how you ingest insights. For example, you can make affinity diagram and if you have collaborator you can ask opinion to your colleagues and if you're not, you can just come up with ideas alone. And then if you have to go back to the previous page and iterate until you find some more interesting insights. Do you agree with this process? And if you think your process is bit different than this, you can make a new diagram accordingly. So you can make this detailed diagram on the next page. Okay."
126;Speaker 1;01:00:52.230;01:01:07.510;00:00:15.280;"Yeah, that's pretty much the step. I don't see a big difference in such a process. I just started with the people cooperate, talk to them, align the idea and make these design priorities. And then."
127;Speaker 3;01:01:07.620;01:01:55.700;00:00:48.080;"Yeah, I see. Okay, then we can you can go to page 20. So in this exercise, we can think about effect of collaborators. Do you think other people's feedback is important when coming up with ideas from this qualitative data? And what do you think is the most important strategy you need to take to induce insights? And can you give us an example of when you're using those strategies to come up with better insights? And also, do you think there are some things that hinders you from indicating insights from qualitative data?"
128;Speaker 1;01:01:58.230;01:02:22.060;00:00:23.830;"Okay, so yes, other people feedback are very important because everyone has a narrow mind. When they come in into a blog, you have to see how other people seem to make it better. What do you think is most what do you mean by insights inside?"
129;Speaker 3;01:02:22.450;01:02:44.140;00:00:21.690;"Yeah. Ideas based on qualitative data. It can be something maybe you learn how to understand your user, or maybe it helps you to find some solution to the problem. The type of insights that you can get from qualitative data."
130;Speaker 1;01:02:44.710;01:03:25.060;00:00:40.350;"Yes, people are natural share beans like me. I like using user interface. I'm sharing with you guys. And I'm sure you guys would check on it and might potentially be utilizing it. So, yes, other people's idea and concept contribute to maybe you have a question. You've been struggling for a long time and you just take that one interview to provide you an easy step to make it, to provide a solution. So, yeah, it's very important. And it's important that when other people are sharing, they're sharing valuable information to help you to identify other opportunities rather than the answer you already have."
131;Speaker 3;01:03:25.630;01:04:13.960;00:00:48.330;"I see. Okay, then let's move on to page 22. So let's imagine there is a human assistant that you can utilize so you can ask the human assistance to whatever task you want to ask. And what task do you want to give to the human assistant to maximize the efficiency of finding insights and also improve the quality of it. And this human assistant can be friends, colleague, family, or crowdsourced worker. To whom do you want to ask help. And also please use this smiley face to indicate, like, where you want to get some support."
132;Speaker 1;01:04:18.890;01:05:21.830;00:01:02.940;"I think the first step preferably discussion analysis. Yes. Or iteration. Well, I'll put in decisions since I'm more like linear. It's like do throughout the process to align understanding level of the same project so you can act on the research in the same way or a similar way. I wouldn't ask a friend, well, maybe a colleague or crowdsourcing workers. I would ask friends and families because their assistant is from like, they might know you and they have a bias. Working with people doesn't know you that well. They come from their background and their perspective. They might be bringing on some really valuable, challenging questions that you oversight."
133;Speaker 3;01:05:22.210;01:05:22.650;00:00:00.440;"Right."
134;Speaker 1;01:05:22.710;01:05:55.240;00:00:32.530;"I want to eliminate. People can easily agree with each other and for improved the quality of the insights because they're from different background, they might be difficult to align my setup first, but once you align, you would contribute the best to the end of quality rather than just have a linear like mindset. Everyone agree. I know you that type of thing."
135;Speaker 3;01:05:57.130;01:06:25.600;00:00:28.470;"I see. I think it's interesting that you mentioned process the worker because many of the previous participants mentioned that they feel reluctant to ask the opinion of crowdsource worker because they were afraid of rebuilding the company secret. So in your case, like doesn't make you not worry about rebuilding some potential secrets of your project."
136;Speaker 1;01:06:26.290;01:06:35.390;00:00:09.100;"If this is in a company scenario, then they must assign HR contract. You just sign an NDA contract and that's on them if they reveal that secret."
137;Speaker 3;01:06:36.910;01:06:45.170;00:00:08.260;"So in case when cross sign NDA contract, then you think it's okay to ask."
138;Speaker 1;01:06:45.340;01:06:56.060;00:00:10.720;"Yeah. Hr and the legal Department handling that. I don't think at this step should be designers concern, researchers concern. If they already get paid, then they should assign a contract."
139;Speaker 3;01:06:56.210;01:08:43.319;00:01:47.109;"I see. That's a good point. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Let's move on to the last exercise. So if you go to page 24, it's the same process. But instead of human assistant, you can imagine there are some AI technology you can use to increase the quality and quantity of insight derived from qualitative data. And on the next page, we put some examples what AI can do. For example, if you go to page 26, maybe AI can generate some text and act like a chatbot. Or maybe it can analyze sentiment of users and like provide if the user feedback is negative or positive to the researcher, and maybe it can summarize the long text into a few sentences. Or it can extract topic from documents. So researchers don't have to go through all the documents to find out what the topic is. Or maybe it can classify where this document belongs to. And if you go to the next page, we also provided some example of data visualization that you can get from this AI analysis. And on the page 28 is also an example, there's a text on the side, and from the right side you can see how the topic flows over time."
140;Speaker 3;01:08:44.069;01:09:12.670;00:00:28.600;"And from page 29, you can see how often the certain words are mentioned in the document and also where in this map those different topics are located. So based on these resources, you can think about how you want to utilize this technology in this diagram that you made. Well, the diagram that we provided."
141;Speaker 1;01:09:13.950;01:10:19.510;00:01:05.560;"Okay, yeah, I kind of agree. I don't have additional to that. The thing is, we're talking about the accurate algorithm to this interaction. So the first step is how do you contribute the trust between knowing okay, it's accurate and knows what I'm talking about because sometimes first of all people might have accent the coding translated from video to the word could be missing or misspelled. And the second is what I'm saying. Like they cannot read the subcontact. I might be seeing something, but subcontact is leaning towards the direction. So that needs to take the researcher to have the human factor. But they can review the word and give all the diagram to help researchers to save time while doing a coding. So it's more on the process rather than creative or conclude."
142;Speaker 3;01:10:19.700;01:10:20.690;00:00:00.990;"Oh, I see."
143;Speaker 1;01:10:20.740;01:10:23.740;00:00:03.000;"Yeah, I agree. I think they can even do memory work now."
144;Speaker 3;01:10:25.630;01:10:34.790;00:00:09.160;"I see. How do you think you can use AI on the stage when you're making affinity diagram."
145;Speaker 1;01:10:51.770;01:11:06.320;00:00:14.550;"With Atlas AI? You set up the code in relationship and they organize it for you. So like basically do the work time consuming tasks rather than but the initial part needs to come from the researcher."
146;Speaker 3;01:11:06.470;01:11:22.510;00:00:16.040;"I see. And when you put this Miley face on the memo, is it about summarizing the document for the researcher or what type of memory do you think AI can do for the researcher?"
147;Speaker 1;01:11:22.690;01:11:39.720;00:00:17.030;"Organize like organizing if you have notes, if you have all the data. So it's almost like Twitter. If you hit on the hashtag, it takes you to all the hashtag organized comments, I see."
148;Speaker 3;01:11:42.430;01:11:54.790;00:00:12.360;"How about the part when you put the smiley face on the conduct analysis alone, is it making the coding process more efficient? Yeah."
149;Speaker 1;01:11:54.830;01:12:20.570;00:00:25.740;"For example, for my own research and interview, I'd like to see how many words were mentioned the most among all the interviewers. And of course we have to distract like a and I also some keywords was mentioned very frequently among all of them. And you identify that word with a program, you don't go through the script."
150;Speaker 3;01:12:22.330;01:12:33.100;00:00:10.770;"Then. Do you also calculate these key words from the software that you're currently used? Do you like manually count them?"
151;Speaker 1;01:12:33.970;01:12:43.960;00:00:09.990;"There's another website, there's another website. Import all the script and they will identify all the words in the number mentioning and you just take that result."
152;Speaker 3;01:12:44.770;01:12:48.880;00:00:04.110;"Can you share your website that you use for that?"
153;Speaker 1;01:12:51.830;01:12:58.620;00:00:06.790;"Oh my God. I'm not on my work computer. I can share with you after the interview?"
154;Speaker 3;01:12:58.770;01:13:12.810;00:00:14.040;"Sure, no problem. Yeah. Like sorry, it went over like 1 hour. I think this is the end of our interview and we really appreciate for your participation."
155;Speaker 1;01:13:13.250;01:13:20.120;00:00:06.870;"No problem. I think I find the site. I'm going to make it under the. Let me make it right here."
156;Speaker 3;01:13:21.170;01:13:21.750;00:00:00.580;"Sure."
157;Speaker 1;01:13:21.860;01:13:25.940;00:00:04.080;"Yeah. This one word counter that I see."
158;Speaker 2;01:13:26.930;01:13:34.900;00:00:07.970;"And also I can share each other's emails and maybe you guys, I can share more information after it is."
159;Speaker 1;01:13:35.040;01:13:35.720;00:00:00.680;"Yeah."
160;Speaker 3;01:13:36.170;01:13:43.340;00:00:07.170;"Thank you. We're going to send you a gift card right after we end the interview. I'm not."
161;Speaker 1;01:13:43.360;01:13:45.020;00:00:01.660;"Don't worry about it. I don't even care."
162;Speaker 2;01:13:46.430;01:13:47.060;00:00:00.630;"No user."
163;Speaker 3;01:13:47.090;01:13:51.450;00:00:04.360;"You guys, thank you so much."
164;Speaker 1;01:13:51.620;01:13:54.220;00:00:02.600;"Yeah, no problem. Thank you. Good luck. To your study."
165;Speaker 3;01:13:54.420;01:13:55.340;00:00:00.920;"Thank you."
166;Speaker 1;01:13:55.850;01:13:57.150;00:00:01.300;"Nice to meet you. Bye."
167;Speaker 3;01:13:57.260;01:14:00.670;00:00:03.410;"Nice to meet you. Bye."
