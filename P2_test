Speaker 2
Hi, Dylan.
 
Speaker 1
Hear you.
 
Speaker 2
Okay. Actually, I'll look to my AirPod. Give me a second. I think it's not working. So I would just do it.
 
Speaker 1
Okay.
 
Speaker 2
So you hear me fine, right?
 
Speaker 1
I hear you fine. Yes. Perfect. Perfect.
 
Speaker 2
Great. Thank you for participating this pilot study and let me get started. Sure. Hi, I'm Daikai. I'm a main researcher for this project. Before we start, I would like to read the content form and by saying yes, you voluntarily agreed to participate in this interview. So let me read the consent form. Actually, I will skip this part. And can you say yes?
 
Speaker 1
Yes, I will agree to being participant in this interview and you can record my audio and transcribe it.
 
Speaker 2
Thank you. And I will ask questions from now on. Can you tell me about your role as a UX researcher at the company when you're working as a UX researcher?
 
Speaker 1
Yeah, I was working before for three years in the folks on Group Future Center in Potsdam. It's called Foxang Group Future Center Europe and it's part of the Fox Baron group. So we were doing user experience design for all the folks brands, like obviously folks Audi, Porsche, others. And I was part of the experience design team and as part of the user experience design team, my role was called UX technologist. We had UX technologists, UX researchers, UX designers, and in those roles we had a kind of flat hierarchy design like our boss tried to establish a new way to run companies. So we had people that could be part of circles. And I was also part of the UX researcher circle. So while I did many coding and only a little bit of design, I also majorly did research as part of my job there.
 
Speaker 2
I see. Then as a UX technologist, did you conduct any user study? Did you interview users and analyze qualitative data?
 
Speaker 1
Yeah. So whenever we had a new project, we usually would go with the traditional human centric process. Sometimes we try to deviate from it a little bit when we felt like it's not necessary. But there was almost every project user research involved and often I was organizing that also majorly because in my groups we actually never had another user experience researcher, so we didn't have one whose main job was doing research. So I was doing this with my project team colleagues.
 
Speaker 2
I see. How many other UX researchers did you collaborate with?
 
Speaker 1
Across my time, research circle had four permanent members and one Cross member and another Cross member like me. Okay. But we were also working with many other user experience researcher from Carriet and from Karmic, which are other folks buying subsidies. They had their own whole UX Department as well. So we work a lot with them. Also. They have we share services, which are the digital services. And actually with them we could do most of our research very easily. So that was what I actually used most because they set up so called we listen regular appointments and we would just use their participants to do our research.
 
Speaker 2
I see.
 
Speaker 1
2030.
 
Speaker 2
I see. Wow, that's a big group.
 
Speaker 1
Yeah, it's many. We work quite well connected.
 
Speaker 2
How often did you analyze qualitative data?
 
Speaker 1
So as part of the research, I try to keep it brief. I know it often takes long, but one thing that was problematic Besides, do we listen? What? I just mentioned this format often. We were not allowed for legal reasons to do the user research on our own. So we would also hire agencies and then these digital agencies would do the research and the analysis of the data on our behalf because for GDPR like data protections reasons, our company did not want to handle the data themselves.
 
Speaker 2
I see.
 
Speaker 1
So fortunately, it's quite bureaucratic interesting. That's why we set it up with other people so often. I would have a second research. So if it's not small research, but bigger research where we would look into a prototype we've built over a long time, we would also hire agency and then they would decide on what methods to do with us, but most importantly, they would transcribe the data and either give us the interviews, but often even do a report in form of a PowerPoint.
 
Speaker 2
Then you didn't really have to transcribe interview data and then do coding to come up with insights from the qualitative data. Instead, you guys hired other agencies to do that for you guys often, but not always.
 
Speaker 1
For this we listen format. For instance, we were not allowed to do video recordings and also not allowed to do voice recordings, but we would do notes. So often we would sit together with multiple people. So I would take a colleague of mine and then do notes while we interview and while we show our prototypes.
 
Speaker 2
I see. Okay. And how is the qualitative data incorporated into the product? Do you think it's well incorporated or do you find any?
 
Speaker 1
That's a very difficult question. It's complicated. I think we were really struggling because I think it's not so much about qualitative data, but it was really a lot more about the organizational structure of the company because it's so big. We didn't even really know where you exit would be positioned and they would set up actually while we were there a new way to organize the company, at least the digital parts of it. So they have a new subsidy called Carrier. And this company would be set up with a safe it's called scale framework. I actually had a few trainings on it as well. And in this system, it's a way to describe how and where requirements and epics and definitions would go in. It's pretty much like project planning and there even UX was not really well positioned. So we would always fight for position, but in theory, we would have a lot of user experience, research findings, all across the company, probably spread out in some PowerPoint documents, and then it would be a lot about knowing people and connecting with them and sharing the results.
 
 
Okay.
 
Speaker 1
So that would be one, like, lose PowerPoint reports. Another one would be if we have built actual prototypes, then these protests often come with documentation, but then the UX research would be part of the prototype. Yeah. So actually there's even, like, different ideologies on how UX research should be incorporated into product. So some would do it more in terms of the data and the findings and then have those well communicated and bring these over to production teams.
 
Speaker 2
Yes.
 
Speaker 1
Or the other one is that what really was my boss's vision more is that actually all project teams have researchers in that team. And then if these teams would do the research on their own, they would actually empathize with the end users while designing the product. So the research knowledge wouldn't be so much on sheets and documents, but it would be more implicit knowledge that the team members have. So the idea of hers was more that if people interact with end users, empathize with them, with their needs, with their values, that they would make better designed products.
 
Speaker 2
Interesting. Thank you. How fast was the project cycle when you're conducting politics data analysis? Did you feel like time pressured? So did you have not enough time to go over that data thoroughly, then just like, skimmed it and just try to apply it easily, or how is it?
 
Speaker 1
I think there's definitely a problem in terms of that's. One problem of these crossfunctional teams, I've said a lot is that if you are a team member, like, if you are with team members from different skills and backgrounds and you try to work together, that can be very exciting and you learn a lot about others. But often the pure research, not like me, but the pure research would have times where they don't have anything to do and others would just be bought and hang out and wait for the results, and then they would have a lot of time pressure to deliver results. Or when I would do the research, I would often also try to be very quick with it because I want to start working on something, and then I would really run over the try to do it as rough and quick and dirty as possible so that we can start working on coding and building prototypes, because I know that that would also be my role. So that would be quite different. So I think because I have this dual role, it would be very different.
 
 
Okay.
 
Speaker 1
Also, one thing I really noticed is that in terms of project outcomes, it really depends on who we were. Almost like a small agency. So it really depends on who comes in, who values what. So often, if we have more engineers coming in as our clients, let's say they would be more interested in functional prototypes, something they can explore, something can see. And then if we had other clients more from the newly for product management, let's say they would only be interested in findings in Qualitative research. Findings actually in the end the company really drifted a lot to these findings documentation, database. One of the reasons why I didn't want to stay there was because the Department of UX, they have a lot of human factors people and they were really so we got now the money from a different boss and these new bosses would care a lot about having a backlog of UX findings in a database. And we would for weeks and weeks just this backlog in a Gyra database. And Gyra is like a coding website, like a code tracker, let's say a back tracker. It's a bug tracker. And we would have a system to document user needs together with evidence from research and would investigate what customer needs are more important because they are setting up a new company which has to build a lot of things because they make a new operating system for cars.
 
Speaker 1
And this new operating system needs really well prioritized functions and definitions of features. So we would for multiple months just prioritize what the user needs are in this backlog together with qualitative and quantitative findings. And then I'll link it many complex web pages. So my work really is very different. I've done very different focus of UX Qualitative data research. So it's not like we had one process and followed it throughout the time I was there. It really changed a lot.
 
Speaker 2
Very interesting. I think you already mentioned a bit about this again, I will skip to the next part. What was the problem that you needed to solve using qualitative data analysis?
 
Speaker 1
Okay, so the one I mentioned last, it was about pretty much prioritizing development. So deciding which features should be built first, what does the user care about most, but also anticipating what will customers need in the long run. And then we would write very complicated visions of the future and based upon this vision we would sort of stress test what the new operating operating system needs to be capable to do because they are setting the system software architecture up now and it should support because the development will take many, many years. It should support pretty much anything we envision in many years as well. So this would be one thing where we did quality research just because it's very time consuming to do quantity research for that we did also a few service. So I also have to say we did mixed methods. So we also did service where we interviewed multiple customer markets but it was also based on interviews. I see the other one would be more these agencies style design project, Sprints, let's say where we would look into like we were working a lot on self driving cars, autonomous cars. And because there's not much knowledge in the company on the needs of elderly, of visually impaired, of wheelchair users.
 
Speaker 1
We had a lot of design sprints where we needed to re get into complete new customer groups and then we would use this to brainstorm or develop and also to build in the way of the human centered design process.
 
Speaker 2
I see. Okay. You mentioned before that you felt pressured reporting a research to other team members, for example, like developers, because they need to code something. While if you don't give the resort they have to wait.
 
Speaker 1
Well, they will start and just do anything.
 
Speaker 2
I see. So does that type of collaboration environment hindered you from conducting qualitative data analysis thoroughly?
 
Speaker 1
Yes, let's not speak negatively of UX research, but because I was in this dual role and we didn't have many developers, I just saw that their need is more and my contribution would be higher if I spent more time on the coding part than on the research part. So it was often on that.
 
Speaker 2
I see. Okay.
 
Speaker 1
But yes, it could have been more thorough. I agree.
 
Speaker 2
Okay. When you are conducting qualitative data analysis, how did you find induced insights from data? How did you develop new ideas to solve UX problems?
 
Speaker 1
So in terms of methods, you mean like affinity diagrams, just traditional coding of insights reports. Often what we sometimes even did, which was really cool, was this type of video reports where you would film people, you interview and then make a whole documentation about the whole process. You would meet with people, first interview them on video, then build something and then later while they explore your prototype, film them again and see their reaction.
 
Speaker 2
Interesting. Then did you collaborate with other US researchers a lot or did you like read your data alone and just come up with ideas?
 
Speaker 1
So both in the beginning it was more separated in teams and then later there was a lot of collaboration with many researchers. I would even meet with them in the offices and discuss the research findings. The user needs database we have set up.
 
Speaker 2
Okay.
 
Speaker 1
One thing we didn't have was sent like no one was really happy with the system we have because it wasn't this Jira database and it was very time consuming to link findings with each other and tickets and there was many duplicates and it felt like a growing database of many needs and it would feel unmanageable at a time. And often we would go through these findings and have them linked back to the original research and depending on how you formulate your findings. So with qualitative research, because you try to summarize complex findings into simpler words, often it becomes at some time also interpretation. And then we would fight a lot. We would sit with people in rooms and discuss for minutes and hours what the exact user needs behind something is because also when we have multiple users who say they want to have fast navigation system with the radio. I have a hard time to mention something though. Okay. Let's say they would want a car where they can watch movies on the road. Then this is a feature, but we would try to document the actual user needs and not just feature requests. So we would try to look at the higher needs and the drive behind the users because we wouldn't just like the idea of research and UX is not just to document actually what people say they want, but to have findings that then actually lead to new insights.
 
Speaker 1
So we would really discuss a lot about this.
 
Speaker 2
Okay. Thank you. To explain this part. Okay. Did you also have to collaborate with other team members who are not UX researchers? How is it different from collaborating with UX related people?
 
Speaker 1
Many personal I can't summarize it too much to I can't really summarize it to the skill or the occupation of the people, but it felt that it's more dependent on the personality. So some people are very good and they would take a lot of effort and be very helpful. They would come up with interesting interview questions, but often let's think about a few individuals. They would have hard time to find anything valuable and they would not see the benefit and could not really contribute to doing UX research.
 
Speaker 2
Why do you.
 
Speaker 1
Oh, was that what you meant? Was that what you asked?
 
Speaker 2
Yeah, but why do you think some people don't see the value of UX research and cannot find interesting insights from the user study data?
 
Speaker 1
I think a lot of disagreement would also be in what is a novel insight and when like basic interview differences where maybe a trained UX researcher would ask a few more indepth questions and people who are not trained would just look at very shallow insights and not ask more in depth.
 
Speaker 2
So there are some people who just look into like shallow answers and ask shallow questions, not ask indepth questions. Yeah, I see. Then if you can have any type of support for finding insights from qualitative data, what support would you want to receive.
 
Speaker 1
From people or from.
 
Speaker 2
I think anything can be possible. You can imagine anything you want.
 
Speaker 1
I know there are some really cool new software platforms that automatically transcribe and document and then you have a searchable database. And to have a searchable database would be really exciting where you can go and jump back to the original interviews and see it again like a centralized database, which is what we try to build in some degrees. But we couldn't use any of these new startups. I don't know what they are called. There are some startups that offer like new types of online based UX research. Finding online databases, something like that would be really cool but like a company like Volkswagen couldn't use it due to GDPR problems, supplier problems.
 
Speaker 2
I see.
 
Speaker 1
Like the it buying process in these car automotive industries is very complex. So we couldn't just use whatever we want to use.
 
Speaker 2
I see. Why do you think having an online database that can link to the source is important to finding insights from qualitative data other than it helps us researchers to organize it better? Do you think it will help to come up with more novel ideas or interesting solutions?
 
Speaker 1
Yeah, I think it's really empathizing with the original interviewees can help a lot. There is a difference. If you write on a sheet of paper that user life can drastically be improved by a ramp in the car. Whereas when you see someone enthusiastically expressing themselves, being heard the first time and being acknowledged for the lack of needs in the regards of cars. So I think there's a huge difference. I almost think that's why I mean, that's also what many people try to be more interdisciplinary. There is something lost if you just present summarized findings rather than interacting with the original material.
 
Speaker 2
I see. Thanks. Okay then if there is a human assistance, how would you like them to help you maximize the efficiency of finding insights from qualitative data and improve the quality of insights?
 
Speaker 1
So one thing I noticed honestly now a bit of a Contra argument, counter argument to what I said before. It gets difficult. The more and more you hear the same things. So if you do interviews on what stresses people in parking situations get bored after having heard of the 10th time, and then you stop being there and stop asking deeper and deeper questions and be like, yeah, okay, he doesn't like being stuck in parking lots. It's okay. But you would probably have to dig deeper and it gets tiresome. So I would like to have some assistance doing these interviews with multiple participants. But yeah, I don't think a digital assistant can do it yet. If you have to fake genuine interest, there's a reason why face to face interviews are better than like online service. It's because if the interviewers care about learning something, you get better insights. And if you would automate it with a chatbot, you would use that. So that's why often if you really care about finding something out and knowing someone's opinion and their drives and motives, your findings will be much better than when you're uninterested. But the more you interview people, the more you professionalized and the less interested you become.
 
Speaker 1
I don't know. On the other hand, psychologists probably also can get some real insights from people. So there are some methods.
 
Speaker 2
I see. Okay then if you can get an assistant from AI. Wait a second. If you can use AI in your work to improve the quality and quantity of insights derived from qualitative data, what do you expect AI to do to help you?
 
Speaker 1
So I think what AI can do a lot better than previous technologies. If you looked at previous technologies that tried to summarize findings. The most exciting thing you would probably get from automated coding tools is get like a network plot which shows which words were mentioned more, but that often looks cool on a page but don't really help you in day to day work. If your interview was about being stressed finding parking space, and then the software just shows parking space very huge inside. But I think these AI tools are getting a lot better with abstracting complex knowledge into shorter summaries. And I would really be interested to see where that could go. If now they could find generalized findings from many data points, that could be very helpful.
 
Speaker 2
I see. Do you think AI can be used to ask more deeper questions? Like you said, human researchers tend to get bored when they ask same questions like for ten times and then do you think like AI can detect that and then promote more interesting questions when the researcher keeps asking similar questions that are very small?
 
Speaker 1
Actually could see two things, both an AI watching me and telling me, oh, your attention is going away from interviewing. Pay attention to the thorough. Like a reminder, almost like I don't know, like automated mood recognition system. But the other one to help brainstorming new questions probably could also be possible. Actually once tried AI tools for brainstorming, which is not writing qualitative interview questions, obviously. But I did that a few times. And if you spend a lot of time occasionally something funny, challenging when you can come out. So I could also see AI being helpful for question generation.
 
Speaker 2
Okay then can you share me like the software that you use for the brainstorming to generate questions? And also you said you use AI to brainstorm?
 
Speaker 1
Like actually I use GPT-3, I have an account there so I could write a prompt and just give me ten ideas of cat toys. And then you would write number one like cat and two and then another stupid idea and then you would right after you gave this prompt another prompt and then it would auto to complete this. Then we would run it a few times. I did that with the official opener. Igpt three, but also there is a worse one from hugging face, but that one doesn't work, didn't work. The only one that works a bit more. But then what was the other one you asked for?
 
Speaker 2
Yes. Do you think you can use AI to brainstorm the insights after you go through the quality data? And when you are trying to come up with solutions for the US problems, do you think you can brainstorm the ideas with AI like you did with question generation?
 
Speaker 1
I don't think it's there yet, but I could see it in the future. Sometimes when you're stuck, it can give you good ideas. I think for ideas like right now pretty much all I know AI does is expand text or shrink text. That's what I think about AI now, mostly if we talk about this, I think mostly about it enlarging short snippets of text, getting more ideas, giving more inspiration or summarizing interview insights. And for summarizing, I think I can see it work. But to make a leap and go from looking at the data and summarizing it to then creating ideas for solving UX problems. I don't think so, no.
 
Speaker 2
Okay. Then you mentioned summarizing and you mentioned that when the AI summarize the UX data, then for example, when it's about parking, then it might just highlight parking as the main topic for that UX data, then it's not that helpful. Then what kind of summarisation do you want to get from AI?
 
Speaker 1
So the last one I see like really helpful summaries where I've seen on Twitter thread of AI summarizing actual research papers in the style that the five year old can read it. That was really fun. Sometimes really accurate. Something like that. I could see.
 
Speaker 2
Can you share the like Twitter ready to find one?
 
Speaker 1
I will look for it.
 
Speaker 2
Thank you. Okay.
 
Speaker 1
I don't have the Twitter set, but I think I found this article. Oh, there it is. I put it here in the chat.
 
Speaker 2
Okay.
 
Speaker 1
Thank you. Yeah, that was fun. I don't know if any of these tools I have. What was it called? Yeah, like Dovetail, for instance, one like that, which we looked at but never used because it was cloud hosted, I think. But there are a few others like it that we were at least discussing in the UX Research Department circle, if we can make any use of it. Okay.
 
Speaker 2
I have another question. Do you think it will be useful to get helped by AI and or additional human assistance in a working environment?
 
Speaker 1
Yes. But I must also say we were in kind of a luxurious environment for a while where my Department had more money than they could spend. So I told you earlier about these agencies which we would hire and they would do research for us, but we didn't do it. So we would have had money to pay a researcher to do research for us, but we didn't because we were thinking something else at the time is more important. So sometimes we felt like we are almost forced to do research, even though we don't think that's what is needed the most because my project group itself was more and more that really was makers who wanted to build things. So we always would want to do small research and then build something. But yeah, it really depends on the project, to be honest. So sometimes the other project in the end, which was more on the operating system there, I would definitely want to have 100 interns helping to organize this database.
 
Speaker 2
I see. It depends on projects.
 
Speaker 1
Yeah. And if there is something you can if there's something you can describe to an intern to be done or easily can hand over, then it's helpful. But often, actually, even with this luxurious situation where we would have money to hire a company which is a professional UX research agency, to do the research fast, I had the situation that I failed. It takes longer to describe. Right. The project plan and if I would just be able to hire the participants and then do it myself. Sometimes describing problem can take longer than.
 
Speaker 2
Right. Thank you for sharing your experience. It really helped me a lot.
 
Speaker 1
I hope so, yes. If you have more questions, come back to me anytime. It was interesting. I mean, it was an interesting experience because in the company I was before doing internship, UX was completely different at UX Research, but we were in the special Department with a very powerful boss. So it was kind of a unique experience.
 
Speaker 2
Yeah, I think it's definitely a unique experience, especially because like an automobile company. So maybe that's why it's unique.
 
Speaker 1
But was also very difficult. Always was the hardware dependency and the long development cycle. So often we would build these prototypes based on user needs, which were very close to what we think the user wants. And then we would show it to the development Department and they say, yeah, we can't do this because of that. And this all is too difficult. So in the automotive industry, often the disconnect between the vision and the reality, the capabilities of what a company can achieve is a bigger concern than the gap between knowing what the people want and showing that. Do you understand me?
 
Speaker 2
Yes.
 
Speaker 1
I think we had more of a production difficulty than like our UX research was great.
 
Speaker 2
That's interesting because I had an interview with my friend who's working at Google and she said she's a UI designer, so she's not working as a UX researchers per se. But she told me that it's difficult to work as a UI designer because UX researchers just throw a bunch of new, interesting ideas instead of just narrowing down their ideas to one solution. Because if you're a developer or UI designer, they want to build a solid prototype, not like making ten kinds of prototypes and then discuss about it. So she said being a UX researcher would be so stressful in that environment because everyone wants an answer, but their job is naturally just to come up with interesting insights and not just providing a solution. So I think it's interesting that you say you really enjoyed UX research, like doing UX research at your company.
 
Speaker 1
The thing is that we didn't have to build something that goes fully on the road, but we would be like more the pre production and then the insights that you find most valuable are the ones that you can choose. But I guess in Google you have always large system that has to go into production soon. It complicates things.
 
Speaker 2
Yeah.
 
Speaker 1
But also one problem, actually, one really big cubics research problem I always felt was this negotiating amongst different interests. So often when you couldn't say objectively what would be a better solution or a higher priority, let's say some people prefer safety and some prefer Privacy. I'm thinking about that because that's also what my research is about currently. I quoted that before. It's difficult to say what has more value. And then people would look to the UX researcher and ask them to give an answer. Yes, but often they cannot. Because what you find is that there are just different values and ideologies and then every user has a different degree of prioritizing those. And then the only thing to answer this often would be like to go to marketing and say our customer base are very Privacy focus consumers. If we want to speak to our old customers, we will make a solution that is very Privacy where but then you don't know, should we actually go more to digital natives who want more AI features? Then you would have a different thing. So often the USB search was also a bit influenced, I think by marketing.
 
Speaker 1
Like what customer group is more important right now, specifically the car industry. Obviously you often focus for the high value customers. So that would also drive your research a lot.
 
Speaker 2
I see. Who are the high value customers in automobile industry.
 
Speaker 1
So with Forks Fargo, you have very few young people, at least in Europe and we wanted to drive it closer to digital natives. But prime customers in Europe are all around 50 men. And also in car, you have to distinguish, we have found in UX research, actually one thing which is that cars currently really under deliver to families and to family needs and children needs. But the problem is the person who buys the car is not the user. So the customer is not the user. The driver decides, the driver decides about the features. And if the man who buys the car is head of the family, wants a big SUV that looks cool, has a lot of value, often would prioritize his own needs above these of others. And then in research we would also probably do this sometimes, or at least not we would do. But product measures would drive us more to not putting too many children features in there because I don't know, that's a bit of oversimplification now, but there always was also a bit of this.
 
Speaker 2
Yeah, I do a lot. Can I come back to you and I come up with more questions after?
 
Speaker 1
Yeah, sure. Sorry if I talk confusing because I'm quite late already, but happy to help you.
 
Speaker 2
Yeah. Thank you so much. Especially when it's too late.
 
Speaker 1
No problem. One thing I want to ask, do you still have time to take Pinot on the weekend?
 
Speaker 2
Of course.
 
Speaker 1
Okay.
 
Speaker 2
Where are you guys going? Are you guys going to like, New York City?
 
Speaker 1
Yeah, to New York City. We book concert tickets for Friday evening and for Sunday we will go to spa spa.
 
Speaker 2
Like bathing type of spa. Oh my God. That's awesome.
 
Speaker 1
We found Valentine's. Was it Valentine's or spring discount in new Jersey?
 
Speaker 2
That's awesome.
 
Speaker 1
It was not Korean. I think it was a Korean spa.
 
Speaker 2
Okay, please go to Korean spa and tell me how was that?
 
Speaker 1
Yeah, I think it was a Korean.
 
Speaker 2
Okay, if it's good, I wanted visit there too.
 
Speaker 1
Okay, then. Good night.
 
Speaker 2
Okay. Good night. Okay. Yeah. I can definitely take Pina during this weekend and Goodnight. Thank you so much. Bye.
