0;Speaker 1;00:00:04.070;00:00:39.300;00:00:35.230;"Thank you for participating in my study. My name is Eugenbey and I am one of your researchers for this project. This project aims to understand the challenges user experience researchers face at work when conducting quality qualitative research. We are especially interested in how AI and crowdsourcing can support US researchers to induce insights from qualitative research. In addition to that, we like to investigate what kind of ethical concerns do user experience researchers based in the industry? And just to confirm, we have your consent to reports interview, correct?"
1;Speaker 2;00:00:39.990;00:00:40.740;00:00:00.750;"Yes."
2;Speaker 1;00:00:41.910;00:00:52.440;00:00:10.530;"Okay. Now let's dig in our interview. Before we get to the workshop, could you briefly describe which company you worked at and what your role at the company was?"
3;Speaker 2;00:00:53.790;00:01:40.090;00:00:46.300;"Yeah, sure. So in the past, I've worked for a variety of HCI related labs as a UX researcher and design engineer. So currently I'm working for two main organizations. One of them is with Opton of the United Health Group, where we will be designing a solution from user research to design to implementation to help employees better participate and engage in optimal programs. And then the other is for a crowd auditing platform where I'm redesigning their interface through user research and testing and iteration."
4;Speaker 1;00:01:40.650;00:01:51.730;00:00:11.080;"Okay, thank you. Now we will start the workshop. I will share a Google Slides link where you will be given detailed instructions on what to do. I'll send it right now on chat."
5;Speaker 2;00:01:59.710;00:02:01.300;00:00:01.590;"Okay. Okay."
6;Speaker 1;00:02:01.750;00:02:13.160;00:00:11.410;"Do you think you can share your screen with me? Yeah. Okay. It's enabled now."
7;Speaker 2;00:02:14.150;00:02:24.240;00:00:10.090;"Okay. Can you see my screen?"
8;Speaker 1;00:02:25.230;00:02:31.980;00:00:06.750;"Yeah, I can see your screen. Okay. You good?"
9;Speaker 2;00:02:32.310;00:02:33.900;00:00:01.590;"Yeah. Okay."
10;Speaker 1;00:02:40.870;00:03:08.600;00:00:27.730;"So there are three parts to this workshop and the goal of the first part is to understand how your team develops a product. You can go to the next slide after that and read the instruction carefully and create a diagram accordingly in the following slide after that, after looking at the example and it's emphasized in the instructions. But make sure to include the qualitative data analysis element and the brainstorming stage in your diagram. Please."
11;Speaker 2;00:03:09.590;00:03:11.550;00:00:01.960;"Wait, can I get access?"
12;Speaker 1;00:03:11.720;00:03:12.800;00:00:01.080;"Oh, sorry."
13;Speaker 2;00:03:13.910;00:03:25.260;00:00:11.350;"How do I do that? Also, do I need to think? Hello?"
14;Speaker 1;00:03:25.770;00:03:27.120;00:00:01.350;"Yeah. Yes, please."
15;Speaker 2;00:03:27.810;00:05:15.980;00:01:48.170;"Okay, I think you have access now. Oh, yeah. Okay, great. Okay. What is the process of your team when developing a product? Please make a simple diagram. Elaborate verbally will make you square boxes for each process and arrows to show you stakeholder circle to indicate who are involved. You can create more shades of different colors if you need to. Okay, I see. I'm going to copy this diagram first and modify later because I'm too lazy to make my own process. I guess it varies by project, but generally we follow like the typical double diamond process. So for all my projects, we usually start with background research, and I guess that's even before user research here. So it will be something like literature review and other forms that's researched before we even start doing user research because we want to understand the problem space. So this will be the first part and then after that we usually move on to user research."
16;Speaker 1;00:05:22.410;00:05:24.420;00:00:02.010;"I don't know what's going on with the."
17;Speaker 2;00:05:30.070;00:08:28.230;00:02:58.160;"Okay. And people involved in this stage are of course, okay, I'll just put it here. People involved are of course searchers. And then in this stage also business related people because we need to understand the client and stakeholder needs if they're also present and then also data science. The project involves analyzing the company's data and then next we move on to user research. Let me arrow here. Okay. Also this can be both quantitative and qualitative. For user research, it usually consists of different types of interviews like semi structure or contextual inquiry. These are mostly qualitatives. And then people involve again UX researchers and maybe business related people if they're part of the target user group. And afterwards we move on to like the synthesizing stage. So I guess that's before brainstorming. So this is the part where you synthesize everything from literature review as well as user research to extract the final research summary and insights. And then here again the US researcher is involved and also the UI designer because they need like a starting point for designing the stuff and understanding your needs. And also to me brainstorming kind of synthesizing because while synthesizing we're starting to think of possible ideas."
18;Speaker 2;00:08:28.360;00:09:52.180;00:01:23.820;"But I guess it also makes sense to put it after sense of sizing. Like sometimes it can happen around the same time. So usually yes, this part I guess also both because UX researchers are like finishing up their work and helping designers idea something. Okay. And then next will be like a cycle of like design and then designing the prototypes first and then a cycle of user testing and evaluation. I'm not really sure how to try that. After design we usually go through a cycle of like testing something and I'm finding design opportunities in the area and I iterate our prototype and I like test again and evaluate again. So it's like a cycle here. Oh yeah, you can help me draw that. Thanks."
19;Speaker 1;00:09:52.810;00:09:54.220;00:00:01.410;"No problem."
20;Speaker 2;00:09:54.550;00:10:20.840;00:00:26.290;"And then finally it's development and for those parties involved, UI designers and also designers and development is usually less for engineers. So should I add something?"
21;Speaker 1;00:10:20.920;00:10:23.530;00:00:02.610;"Or you can add like a circle."
22;Speaker 2;00:10:24.270;00:10:24.990;00:00:00.720;"Okay."
23;Speaker 1;00:10:25.150;00:10:26.640;00:00:01.490;"Like a different color."
24;Speaker 2;00:10:57.930;00:11:32.860;00:00:34.930;"And also in my past project I was always doing research at the beginning and then designed the very end. So the role of UX and UI designers like a single person. But I guess if we do separate, it makes sense to have the UI designer be more involved towards the very end. And then also depending on the project, the business related people, like if they're clients, they should be involved throughout the entire process."
25;Speaker 1;00:11:33.850;00:11:34.320;00:00:00.470;"Okay."
26;Speaker 2;00:11:34.400;00:11:42.880;00:00:08.480;"So it kind of varies. I'm not sure where to put whether I should put business here."
27;Speaker 1;00:11:43.020;00:11:52.070;00:00:09.050;"Do you think, like most of the work you've done mostly included all the business people in most of the stages or it just depends."
28;Speaker 2;00:11:52.990;00:12:19.850;00:00:26.860;"I think it really depends because currently my work with Optimum, since it's like a contract client work, the client is involved in all these stages, and we have weekly check ins with a client, and they want to see us along, like every step of the process. But then for my other project where it's just redesigning a website for a research group, there are no business related people involved."
29;Speaker 1;00:12:20.410;00:12:28.720;00:00:08.310;"Maybe since your most recent work has been involving the business, people put it in all the stages they were involved in."
30;Speaker 2;00:12:29.170;00:12:57.860;00:00:28.690;"Yeah, sure. Thank you very much."
31;Speaker 1;00:12:57.880;00:13:18.650;00:00:20.770;"Now, using the same diagram, just go to the next slide. It explains it, but basically you're putting, like, the red lightning shape on the challenges and using a bullet point, you can know what challenges there were very smart."
32;Speaker 2;00:13:22.550;00:13:42.980;00:00:20.430;"Okay. I feel like that's very personal. And then there are challenges in every single step. But for me, for me, the most challenging. Wait, how many of this can't put down?"
33;Speaker 1;00:13:43.060;00:13:47.340;00:00:04.280;"You can put as many as you need if you feel that every stage has."
34;Speaker 2;00:13:47.670;00:15:48.990;00:02:01.320;"Oh, okay. Yeah, there are a few. First of all, this is very challenging. Let me put down everything and I'll explain it later. Okay. I think these three areas are the most challenging for me. So for this one, I find it very challenging because I always get started with a super broad problem space, and I don't really know what to look for or where to go. So, for example, my current project, they gave us a very broad project description before we got started. They just asked us to find solutions to improve employee participation in or like, adoption of their wellness programs. And then they don't really give us any more details after that. So my team and I, we weren't really sure what to look for. And as a result, we had to conduct literature review and background research on so many topics related to this problem area, which caused us to always get lost and become really unsure of what we're even looking for. Things that will help us with this is just to meet regularly with the clients to ask if we're on the right track. But this is definitely very difficult because we have to familiarize ourselves with the problem space and narrow down the problem scope."
35;Speaker 2;00:15:50.630;00:17:34.450;00:01:43.820;"The other part I find challenging is this part designing the prototype, because prior to the stage, we're always doing things on paper, on Google Docs or on whiteboards or sticky notes and not really doing anything visual. So I find it very hard to turn a sentence into a few wire frames, if you know what I mean. Yeah. Like the transition from user research insights to actual wire streams. I find that kind of difficult. And then what I found helpful is if I'm working with a group, we do parallel prototyping, so we get to see a bunch of different ideas, and then we combine aspects we like from everyone's ideas, or if I'm doing things by myself, then I just look for inspirations online and also combines multiple aspects from different products. And then lastly, for this cycle, I do put this down, but it kind of varies depending on the project. Sometimes it's not that difficult because it's mostly, like visual refinements or adding small features here and there, and then the prototype has already been kind of developed, so it's not too difficult to further refine it. But other times, this cycle is often conducted under very limited time constraints."
36;Speaker 2;00:17:38.170;00:18:15.690;00:00:37.520;"As designers, we often feel extremely rushed to constantly have to find people to test and reevaluate, and iterate on our prototypes. Yeah. Also, when we're doing that, user recruitment is also really hard because we can't really always use the same people to test different Fidelity for different iterations of our prototype."
37;Speaker 1;00:18:17.750;00:19:18.240;00:01:00.490;"Okay, that sounds good. Sorry. Okay, thank you. Now, the third part of the first part would be focusing on the challenges that arise, specifically in the brainstorming stage and the solutions to those challenges. But I think you went, oh, wait. Also, you had to put in the brainstorming stage in part one. Oh, did you put it. Oh, you did? Okay, well, then can you just tell me if there were any problems in the brainstorming stage or if there weren't, then I guess that's fine. Sorry. I'm going to look at it. Yeah. Because I guess they just assumed that there would be a problem in the brainstorming."
38;Speaker 2;00:19:18.270;00:20:35.020;00:01:16.750;"Yeah, I guess there were problems in the brainstorming stage for one of my past projects. So in that project, I was working with five other teammates, and we had to come up with a single product at the very end. And during our brainstorm stage, each of us came up with 15 different design ideas, which came out to be, like 90 in total. And we had to narrow that down to one single idea. So that was a bit difficult to begin with. But what helped us was that we put off our ideas onto and then we kind of do, like, affinity diagramming with these ideas. So we put them in clusters, found some similarities, and then we began building first on the larger categories, and then we slowly start to narrow them down and further cluster them, and then again. So we went through this cycle several times and finally landed on one single idea."
39;Speaker 1;00:20:35.830;00:20:39.830;00:00:04.000;"Okay. Was it, like, time consuming?"
40;Speaker 2;00:20:40.570;00:21:00.530;00:00:19.960;"It was a bit time consuming at first when we had to categorize and clean up 90 different sticky notes. But as time moves on, it got much easier. And along the way, we also got any feedback from people like professors or other designers."
41;Speaker 1;00:21:01.090;00:21:31.970;00:00:30.880;"Okay, that sounds part one. And for part two, the goal of this is to understand general challenges user experienced researchers face when they conduct qualitative data analysis practice in the industry. So first you're going to make a diagram that shows the usual process of qualitative data analysis, as the example shows, and like you were doing before. Please elaborate verbally when you make the diagram."
42;Speaker 2;00:21:33.370;00:23:28.020;00:01:54.650;"Okay, again, I will copy this because I don't want to make my deck from scratch. Very nice. Yeah. Let's see. First, data collection preparation. I'm not too sure what this means, so I will delete it because I never really used this in my own practice. I do have data collection. I never really had to prepare data because I always was like finding or researching about available data. And I guess the other thing is like literature review. And if it's qualitative, then user interview is also a big category. Before we sign initial themes, we usually do something like affinity diagramming. This is where we find similarities and categories amongst our data and that will also help us with finding things in the next part, I guess. Yeah. After this we will find things. And I never really had to do coding, but during my undergrad I used to software Mvvo once. Have you heard of it?"
43;Speaker 1;00:23:28.770;00:23:29.960;00:00:01.190;"Sorry, what?"
44;Speaker 2;00:23:30.160;00:23:33.690;00:00:03.530;"Oh, I used this software called Mvivo."
45;Speaker 1;00:23:33.880;00:23:35.470;00:00:01.590;"I've not heard of it."
46;Speaker 2;00:23:35.640;00:25:01.640;00:01:26.000;"Okay. It's for like coding qualitative data. A lot of user researchers use that. It's basically like manually going through qualitative data and creating different Tags and adding words to those texts. So it's not really like coding in terms of programming, the more like highlighting data. Okay. But other than that, for my recent work, I never really had to do coding. I'm also not sure what memos are, so I will delete it as well. After we find things, I guess we just put it in a presentable format. So whether it's slice for team members, I never really do put an academic paper because my findings then go into brainstorming and design prototyping. But I do have to do executive summaries to summarize my research activities or for presentations to clients. So, yeah, this is like my overall process."
47;Speaker 1;00:25:02.030;00:25:11.130;00:00:09.100;"Okay, thank you. Now, the same thing indicate the red lighting icon challenge."
48;Speaker 2;00:25:35.110;00:26:59.830;00:01:24.720;"Okay, this is really quick, but I guess that's fine. And then this also ties into what I said previously about this part. It's Uber. It's basically the same thing where I always find an initial problem space too broad and I don't know what to look for or don't know where to start with. Or sometimes I tend to fall into the black hole reading too many things related to a single small area that might not be as important instead of researching on many broad areas. So that's a challenge. And then for user interviews, recruiting is always a challenge, especially for groups that involve very specialized users. And I don't find these parts as difficult because once we actually put down our ideas through affinity diagrams, it's much easier to work with existing data and find patterns or common categories, and then naturally from that we can find some common themes and then extract summaries and insights."
49;Speaker 1;00:27:03.070;00:27:20.930;00:00:17.860;"That's great. Okay, so I guess we can move on. This is basically like using that format that's given in the example. Just show what tools you use to generate insights from your data, if there are any that are involved in each of those stages."
50;Speaker 2;00:27:23.230;00:27:31.540;00:00:08.310;"So do I need to copy this and fill it in for every single part?"
51;Speaker 1;00:27:31.870;00:27:34.720;00:00:02.850;"Do you use a tool for every single part?"
52;Speaker 2;00:27:37.190;00:28:20.380;00:00:43.190;"Let me see. Not every single part, but let me copy this first. Oh, wait, I need to copy this. Wait, do things like Google Docs and Slides count as two of us?"
53;Speaker 1;00:28:21.190;00:28:30.580;00:00:09.390;"Google Docs? I mean, I guess if it's like a significant contribution in those stages, it's fine."
54;Speaker 2;00:28:32.350;00:28:33.040;00:00:00.690;"Okay."
55;Speaker 1;00:28:33.180;00:28:35.800;00:00:02.620;"Yeah, I guess so."
56;Speaker 2;00:28:35.820;00:29:42.850;00:01:07.030;"Right? It's a tool. Yeah. Let me see, because I feel like I use Google for pretty much all the stages and everyone knows what it does, so I don't really need to talk too much about it. Maybe one specialized too. For the affinity diagramming stage, we use like Zip, Jam or Nero and our goal will be organized the keynotes efficiently. I guess it's like specifically designed for team collaboration and whiteboarding because currently some of my things are remote, so we always end up using Fiction or mirror."
57;No speaker;00:29:43.590;00:29:44.340;00:00:00.750;"Okay."
58;Speaker 2;00:29:44.910;00:31:59.080;00:02:14.170;"Because people can collaborate in real time and request the keynote, or someone can share their screen and then we can all see our progress. I guess there aren't too many limitations. One thing is like lack of integration with other software. For example, to transfer our sticky notes to things like Google Slides or Docs or even Sigma, we have to export everything as like a PPNG or PDF, and I'm like manually insert it, which can be annoying. And if we edit something, we have to go back, export that again, and then insert again. So that's the only limitation I can think of. Otherwise, I'm pretty satisfied with everything I'm using other strategies we use just like Wording in person, or we do discussions, discuss our research findings to take notes. Yeah, this is pretty much the only specialized tool I use. I know for other researchers, like, for example, people who work with more data, they tend to do more coding, or other people they use qualitative analysis offer. But I'm not too specialized in one area. I'm more of like a general UX researcher slash designer. So this is the only tool I'm using."
59;Speaker 1;00:31:59.410;00:32:01.420;00:00:02.010;"Okay, yeah, that's fine."
60;Speaker 2;00:32:01.870;00:32:02.340;00:00:00.470;"Okay."
61;Speaker 1;00:32:02.420;00:32:41.050;00:00:38.630;"I guess that's the final part of part two. And for part three, it's the last part of the workshop, and it's to understand the challenges and opportunities of inducing insights from qualitative data. And first, using the diagram, I think you use the diagram from your part two that you created above, color steps that help you find insights with green background, like the example and just explain why those are important for inducing insights."
62;Speaker 2;00:32:55.930;00:33:12.890;00:00:16.960;"Yeah. For me it's just affinity documenting because it helps me to like, see common trends or Amosta data or like, group them into similar clusters or categories."
63;Speaker 1;00:33:26.330;00:33:48.810;00:00:22.480;"I guess, like in the light blue, like the initial themes and quality of coding in the example, like green, it's like those that help you find. That helps you find insights. Instead of like, inducing insights, the bright green is. Sorry, I think I got it wrong. Like the bright is the inducing and the light green is for that helps you find insights."
64;Speaker 2;00:33:51.050;00:33:51.700;00:00:00.650;"Okay."
65;Speaker 1;00:33:51.840;00:33:52.520;00:00:00.680;"Yeah."
66;Speaker 2;00:33:54.470;00:35:07.030;00:01:12.560;"I feel like for me, everything. Everything kind of falls under this category because I don't really use qualitative coding software. So for me, I don't need to find initial things and I do qualitative coding. Okay. All I need to do is do affinity background. Maybe the most I will do before that is before and after discussion with teammates or clients to see if we're all on the same page about our findings before or after the city diagramming. Yeah. Okay. Maybe we will always go over this diagram or just before them, we will kind of like go over the research activities we did to make sure we're all on the same page. Okay. Yeah."
67;Speaker 1;00:35:07.140;00:35:31.190;00:00:24.050;"And then the next I think you have to rearrange diagram probably cause you're trying to show like another diagram that shows a process of inducing insights from qualitative data to report. I guess yours will be pretty simple because you said it's just involved, like before and after discussions."
68;Speaker 2;00:35:31.750;00:35:42.880;00:00:11.130;"Yeah, I'm kind of confused by what I'm supposed to do here. Like, does everything here fall under iteration, boxings and coding? Yeah."
69;Speaker 1;00:35:48.710;00:35:57.800;00:00:09.090;"I think that's what you're supposed to do. Like whatever you identified as inducing insight. Like you owe the process."
70;Speaker 2;00:35:59.450;00:37:14.330;00:01:14.880;"Okay. For me, there isn't really a process since it's only one thing I can make a very simple background. Literally the most I do is put everything in the keynote. Maybe I'll pick one key and find everything similar to it. Continue with the second. This is the most detailed process I can think of."
71;Speaker 1;00:37:14.500;00:37:53.400;00:00:38.900;"I guess you can put the part where you said you discussed with people before the sticky note. Because this whole process is affinity diagramming. Right. And it's just like a cycle of this whole process."
72;Speaker 2;00:37:54.990;00:38:07.550;00:00:12.560;"Usually it's like a linear process. Maybe for this part, if someone disagrees, we can revisit the tag and shuffle some notes."
73;Speaker 1;00:38:08.410;00:38:09.960;00:00:01.550;"But usually it's fine."
74;Speaker 2;00:38:10.040;00:38:38.500;00:00:28.460;"Yeah. Usually it's like linear. And then for this part, I've done this once during undergrad where I had to use the MV Boat software to co qualitative data. But for that part, this PhD I work with just gave me all the initial things and told me to code that. So I don't really have to go through different iterations. I just have to."
75;Speaker 1;00:38:42.490;00:38:57.800;00:00:15.310;"Okay. I think I just answered those questions and other people see it back important. Can you give an example?"
76;Speaker 2;00:39:00.890;00:40:26.360;00:01:25.470;"Yeah, I think of course like feedback is essential when you're synthesizing your findings or trying to finalize on your scenes because sometimes there are patterns or trends that you don't notice that other people might have noticed. That can be important. So for example, when I was doing user interviews, like informal user interviews for my current project with autism, we were a microphone talking about our findings and writing down some common things. Again using affinity programming. And then my teammates found some important aspect about he post towards employers that I personally haven't noticed from my interviews and my examinations of other people's interview notes. And then that aspect of trust turn up to be very important for the clients. So I do think that people's feedback are important. But again, on the other hand, too much feedback can sometimes be very distracting and slow down the entire process."
77;Speaker 1;00:40:29.010;00:40:38.050;00:00:09.040;"What do you think is most important to end use insights and could you also give a brief example for that? If you do think there is an important aspect."
78;Speaker 2;00:40:41.290;00:40:53.730;00:00:12.440;"Can you give me an example of what you're asking for? Is there like a specific tool or a kind of activity?"
79;Speaker 1;00:40:54.350;00:41:17.340;00:00:22.990;"I think what the question is asking. Well, I did not come up with the question, so I might be wrong, but what I'm thinking is what do you think is the most important, like stage insight for process or is there a do you still not understand?"
80;Speaker 2;00:41:18.090;00:41:58.980;00:00:40.890;"I kind of understand. I think for me the most important and most useful part is just like taking a look at all the data you have noticed you have gathered closely, like as a whole and finding trends or patterns across everything. Instead of, for example, looking at a single interview or a single paper to extract findings, it's important to look at everything as a whole and see like try to find a similarities between different data or different types of data."
81;Speaker 1;00:41:59.490;00:42:06.360;00:00:06.870;"Okay. And the next question is what hinders you from inducing insights from qualitative data?"
82;Speaker 2;00:42:10.150;00:42:35.240;00:00:25.090;"Sometimes there's just too much words, so I get really lost or I get very overwhelmed by the number of things I have to read or the amount of notes I have to look at. And it's very easy for me to miss details here and there."
83;Speaker 1;00:42:36.170;00:42:38.480;00:00:02.310;"Okay. Thank you."
84;Speaker 2;00:42:44.190;00:42:44.480;00:00:00.290;"Yeah."
85;Speaker 1;00:42:44.500;00:42:47.170;00:00:02.670;"I think you copy and paste your number two diagram."
86;Speaker 2;00:42:49.750;00:43:00.680;00:00:10.930;"And maximum efficiency improved quality. What do I do with my we face?"
87;Speaker 1;00:43:05.010;00:43:09.740;00:00:04.730;"Let me read it. I'm not too sure because I think this part got added later on."
88;Speaker 2;00:43:09.940;00:43:10.510;00:00:00.570;"Okay."
89;Speaker 1;00:43:10.620;00:43:35.590;00:00:24.970;"Yeah. If there is a human assistant, how would you like to help you? I think in that process, if there was a human assistant, which stage of them helping would maximize the efficiency of finding and improve the quality of insights."
90;Speaker 2;00:43:35.780;00:43:36.520;00:00:00.740;"Okay."
91;Speaker 1;00:43:44.210;00:43:57.840;00:00:13.630;"And you could also tell me who you would like to ask for help. It can be anyone like in this example, like friends, colleagues, family, crowdsource, workers, et cetera."
92;Speaker 2;00:43:57.990;00:44:15.110;00:00:17.120;"Okay. I mean for me this part is definitely super time consuming. Like this entire part. Okay, sorry, this is kind of ugly."
93;Speaker 1;00:44:15.730;00:44:16.730;00:00:01.000;"That's fine."
94;Speaker 2;00:44:16.900;00:44:50.140;00:00:33.240;"I will love for a machine to do it for me in 1 second. But of course this is like qualitative data so it's very hard for computers to work with and very subjective. So I guess I would want a professional UX researcher to do this for me. And then after they finished categorizing all the sticky notes, I can take it over and continue with my own research work."
95;Speaker 1;00:44:50.340;00:44:55.170;00:00:04.830;"So you would like the professional UX researchers to categorize like do this entirely?"
96;Speaker 2;00:44:55.490;00:44:59.670;00:00:04.180;"Yeah, because often this process is like super time consuming."
97;Speaker 1;00:45:01.010;00:45:03.380;00:00:02.370;"Sorry, I'm just going to note that down just in case."
98;Speaker 2;00:45:10.410;00:45:18.720;00:00:08.310;"And I feel like only UX researchers or people in similar positions can understand what we're trying to do."
99;Speaker 1;00:45:27.910;00:45:32.560;00:00:04.650;"Okay, but aren't you a UX researcher as well?"
100;Speaker 2;00:45:34.030;00:45:38.630;00:00:04.600;"I won't want someone else to do it for me. I'm too lazy."
101;Speaker 1;00:45:39.730;00:45:42.160;00:00:02.430;"Then what would you be doing? The other things."
102;Speaker 2;00:45:42.300;00:45:44.380;00:00:02.080;"I will be taking a break."
103;Speaker 1;00:45:47.230;00:45:52.780;00:00:05.550;"You would like them to do that part for you and then you carry on with the rest. Too much time?"
104;Speaker 2;00:45:53.290;00:46:05.870;00:00:12.580;"Yeah, it's just that this is too time consuming and very inefficient. But only humans can do it because it's very subtractive."
105;Speaker 1;00:46:09.530;00:46:21.900;00:00:12.370;"Okay, yeah, I think this is the same question, but if an AI were to help you improve, what would you expect the AI to help you with?"
106;Speaker 2;00:46:23.430;00:46:43.210;00:00:19.780;"Yeah, I'm guessing the same thing. If it's possible with AI, I would definitely use AI. And something else. Maybe like AI can generate things like word clouds or automatically generate a summary from super long papers. That would also be very helpful."
107;Speaker 1;00:46:48.550;00:46:54.010;00:00:05.460;"I guess I can do it for you. So you just want the same thing, but like in blue, I think you know what it."
108;Speaker 2;00:46:54.050;00:46:55.840;00:00:01.790;"Yeah, pretty much the same thing."
109;Speaker 1;00:47:00.770;00:47:04.550;00:00:03.780;"What was it like the word cloud automatically generate summary."
110;Speaker 2;00:47:04.740;00:47:09.270;00:00:04.530;"But that would be like an initial research stage. So not really this stage."
111;Speaker 1;00:47:15.750;00:47:29.180;00:00:13.430;"Oh, thank you. I think that is it. I have no clue what these other images are."
112;Speaker 2;00:47:29.750;00:47:54.420;00:00:24.670;"Okay, yeah, I guess these things can also help, like sentiment analysis, text summarization. I would definitely use them. My only concern is that sometimes they can fail to detect or notice important details or they can categorize things in a very biased way."
113;Speaker 1;00:47:58.570;00:48:05.900;00:00:07.330;"I think I just have to ask you a couple follow up questions. Now that we're done, you have to leave at 530."
114;Speaker 2;00:48:05.910;00:48:08.350;00:00:02.440;"Yeah, okay."
115;Speaker 1;00:48:08.390;00:48:09.820;00:00:01.430;"I'll try to be."
116;Speaker 2;00:48:10.510;00:48:13.990;00:00:03.480;"Yeah, I can stay for five more minutes."
117;Speaker 1;00:48:14.150;00:48:26.610;00:00:12.460;"Okay, so follow up question number one. What is good qualitative data analysis in the context of business compared to academia?"
118;Speaker 2;00:48:28.850;00:48:54.270;00:00:25.420;"For a business, it's definitely something. It's definitely like extracting insights that can help businesses to achieve their goals or help them discover like inside related to their customers or products that they previously do not know about. In general, it's very profit oriented."
119;Speaker 1;00:48:54.440;00:49:02.310;00:00:07.870;"Yeah. Okay. Are there cases where UX researchers make final decisions?"
120;Speaker 2;00:49:09.810;00:49:45.790;00:00:35.980;"I feel like that also varies because, for example, if they're working in an academic setting and then they're like the only US people or the only researchers, then of course they probably get to make the final decisions. And third situations is where the client has little knowledge about UX and then they kind of rely on the US researchers to do everything. Then they would probably put more trust in the UX researchers to make decisions."
121;Speaker 1;00:49:48.790;00:49:54.710;00:00:05.920;"Do you personally want to make more decisions or are you like fine with the way it is or less decisions?"
122;Speaker 2;00:49:56.170;00:50:30.330;00:00:34.160;"I think that it really depends on who I am working with or working for and whether I believe that my findings are very important because sometimes if I'm working with other US researchers and I'm just looking to learn from them, then I wouldn't really want to make the final decision. If I'm the sole researcher, then I would be comfortable with making decisions."
123;Speaker 1;00:50:33.810;00:50:42.940;00:00:09.130;"Just a couple more questions. How do you convince your team members to conduct an external user study?"
124;Speaker 2;00:50:45.430;00:50:53.440;00:00:08.010;"How do I customize them? Well, like by team members, assuming other UX researchers depends, I guess."
125;Speaker 1;00:50:54.010;00:51:05.420;00:00:11.410;"Do you usually work in groups of UX researchers or just like various different specialty people? In one group you still work with general lists."
126;Speaker 2;00:51:05.450;00:51:31.370;00:00:25.920;"So we do everything together from your research to design. So I guess in the research phase for all researchers and I never really encountered this situation before because we all have the same mindset regarding user research and we do always try to find external users to interview since they will provide us invaluable insights."
127;Speaker 1;00:51:31.540;00:51:55.660;00:00:24.120;"Right. Okay, I think that's it then. Let me see. Oh, just like two more questions. Is that okay? That's okay. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Do you think UX research is like valued at your company or in companies in general?"
128;Speaker 2;00:51:57.790;00:52:49.770;00:00:51.980;"I think they're starting to get more and more valued because in the past UX wasn't a very important thing. And then company often saw UX researchers and designers as just like visual people or people not doing many meaningful work. But I do feel like they're starting to get more and more value. And as you can see, there are so many new jobs related to just UX research. And HCI is also really rapidly growing field. Again, some companies are still in a stage of slowly starting to realize the value of UX research."
129;Speaker 1;00:52:49.940;00:52:57.740;00:00:07.800;"So overall, you think the importance is just growing? Yeah, it's not already important to them."
130;Speaker 2;00:52:58.610;00:53:06.090;00:00:07.480;"Okay, sorry."
131;Speaker 1;00:53:06.130;00:53:06.960;00:00:00.830;"I'm like."
132;Speaker 2;00:53:09.630;00:53:35.490;00:00:25.860;"They'Re saying sometimes user research, US research can get a bit confusing. Like some people don't really know what it is or some people kind of assume you're doing consulting or just design. Sorry, what I've also encountered some of these situations."
133;Speaker 1;00:53:35.680;00:53:38.870;00:00:03.190;"So you think some people are just unfamiliar with the field?"
134;Speaker 2;00:53:39.050;00:53:43.740;00:00:04.690;"Yeah, like some people just like going don't know what we do."
135;Speaker 1;00:53:46.390;00:54:00.110;00:00:13.720;"Okay. I think that's it for the question. Thanks a lot. Yes, that was very helpful. Hope you have a wonderful."
